[46] DOCTOR: Or was it difficult to say?

[57] PATIENT: I haven't , I felt a bit hot and sweaty, but I haven't really measured it, so I can't really say.
[58] DOCTOR: OK, fine.
[59] DOCTOR: Um, uh, uh, and Kim, have to ask um, uh all all all patients.
[60] DOCTOR: This this question is about your cycle, if you don't mind me asking.
[61] DOCTOR: Um, are you currently um, are you currently sexually active?
[62] PATIENT: Yes.
[63] PATIENT: Uh, yeah I've, I have had the same partner, I am, we were last sexually active about four days ago.

[66] DOCTOR: So you've had no other partner since then.
[67] PATIENT: No, the .
[68] DOCTOR: OK. Um, uh, and do you use any contraception at all?

[77] DOCTOR: Two week scare, OK.
[78] DOCTOR: So, is there any chance you could be pregnant?
[79] DOCTOR: I know you've got an implement in there, but is there any chance you could potentially be pregnant?
[80] DOCTOR: It's something for us to think about
[81] PATIENT: Well, we don't use any other barrier, method so, we just use the , I just have the Implanon and the same partner.
[82] PATIENT: Um.
[83] PATIENT: Theoretically, if the Implanon, hasn't been working then I could be pregnant, but I don't suspect .
[84] DOCTOR: Yeah, OK. Well it's something for us to think about.
[85] DOCTOR: Um, uh, maybe worth taking a pregnancy test later on, just to confirm that.
[86] DOCTOR: Um
[87] DOCTOR: OK. And, and so, just to summarize so far, if you don't mind, it's really for the last couple of days, it's tummy pain that's really affected you, mainly lower down towards your belly button.

[89] DOCTOR: It's getting worse.

[104] PATIENT: I've never , I've never had these symptoms before.
[105] DOCTOR: No, OK. Um
[106] DOCTOR: Fine.
[107] DOCTOR: Um, any other family history I should be aware of?

[109] PATIENT: No, not that , not that I'm aware of, no.
[110] DOCTOR: OK. Alright.

[116] DOCTOR: What do you do for work?
[117] PATIENT: I am an accountant.
[118] DOCTOR: OK. Um
[119] DOCTOR: OK. Um, Do you smoke at all, Kim?
[120] PATIENT: No.
[121] DOCTOR: No.
[122] DOCTOR: And do you drink much in the way of alcohol?
[123] PATIENT: Uh , socially I drink, but uh, I don't think more, more than normal.
[124] PATIENT: .
[125] DOCTOR: No, OK.
[126] DOCTOR: OK. Um, just before I go to the examination, I just want to go through just some few screening questions if that's OK, yes or no.
[127] DOCTOR: Uh, we've, we've covered the majority of them already.
[128] DOCTOR: Uh, but I just want to make sure I'm not missing anything else.
[129] PATIENT: All right.
[130] DOCTOR: Um, how's your, how's your chest?
[131] DOCTOR: How's your breathing?
[132] DOCTOR: Um, any
[133] PATIENT: I don't feel short of breath uh, or, I'm not having any problems, or I don't have a cough or anything that's , worrying me.
[134] DOCTOR: OK. Any uh, funny heartbeats or rhythms, palpitations?
[135] PATIENT: Not that it, no.
[136] DOCTOR: OK. Any headaches?
[137] DOCTOR: Any problems with your vision?
[138] PATIENT: No.
[139] DOCTOR: No, OK. Alright.
[140] DOCTOR: Um,
[141] DOCTOR: Fine, OK. Um, So really just uh, moving on, um,
[142] DOCTOR: And so based, based on your story really, uh, uh Kim it's, it's it's difficult.
[143] DOCTOR: it's it's um, you know you've got some tummy pain.
[144] DOCTOR: You don't exactly know what's causing it.
[145] DOCTOR: It could be a few different things that could be causing your pain.
[146] DOCTOR: Could just be a, you know, could just be a urine infection, for example.
[147] DOCTOR: Could just be something related to your gut.
[148] DOCTOR: Um, could just be something related to your, you know, a pregnancy-related cause.
[149] DOCTOR: Um, and so it's probably worth doing some tests initially.
[150] DOCTOR: to try and rule out um, what's going on here.
[151] DOCTOR: Um, which I can organize for you today.
[152] PATIENT: OK.
[153] DOCTOR: Um, and basically those tests, we, we'll have a better idea in terms of how we should proceed.
[154] DOCTOR: But certainly, it if it's been going on for the last couple of days, um,
[155] DOCTOR: Uh, you know, it's probably maybe worth empirically treating you for a maybe urine infection.
[156] DOCTOR: And, so it's an
[157] PATIENT: .
[158] PATIENT: Yeah, I , can we do that instead of me, going for tests, and then seeing how that goes?
[159] DOCTOR: Yeah, absolutely.
[160] DOCTOR: So, um I think it's certainly worth, you know covering you with some antibiotics today.
[161] DOCTOR: Uh, but i still want you to bear in mind, you know, have a pregnancy test done to make sure we're not missing anything else here.
[162] DOCTOR: And, um, and I want you to kind of really come back and see me in a few days time, if your symptoms are not getting any better, or indeed if they're getting worse.
[163] DOCTOR: So, things to look out for would be, you know, worsening tummy pain, um, if you're feeling really hot or sweaty, your temperature's not coming down um, vomiting et cetera.
[164] DOCTOR: Does that make sense?
[165] PATIENT: Yeah, I think I'm happy with that plan.
[166] DOCTOR: OK. Um, you can try just regular painkillers, uh, Paracetamol would be advisable.
[167] DOCTOR: Um, make sure you drink plenty of fluids.
[168] DOCTOR: You can try some cranberry juice as well, which uh, can sometimes help with your urine symptoms.
[169] DOCTOR: Um, take the antibiotics, uh, and give me a call, you know, if you are worried about anything else.
[170] PATIENT: Uh, sure.
[171] PATIENT: That sounds great.
[172] PATIENT: Thank you very much.
[173] PATIENT: Um, should I just collect the script at my pharmacy?
[174] DOCTOR: Yeah, if I send it straight to your pharmacy, start the antibiotics today, something called Trimethoprim.
[175] DOCTOR: Um, you can take two tablets, uh, one tablet twice a day for three days.
[176] PATIENT: OK.
[177] PATIENT: OK, , that sounds great.
[178] DOCTOR: Uh, , let's see how you get on.
[179] PATIENT: OK.
[180] PATIENT: Thank you very much.
[181] DOCTOR: Great.
[182] DOCTOR: All the best!
[183] PATIENT: Bye.

[1] DOCTOR: Hi, there.
[2] DOCTOR: Good morning!
[3] DOCTOR: Uh, I'm Dr. Dean Mesa from Babylon.
[4] DOCTOR: Can you hear me OK?
[5] PATIENT: Yep.
[6] PATIENT: Can you find
[7] DOCTOR: Yeah, OK, great.
[8] DOCTOR: Well, nice to see you this morning.
[9] DOCTOR: Um, before we start your appointment, could I confirm your full name and date of birth please?
[10] PATIENT: Uh yeah, uh Jack Smith, uh thirty first October nineteen ninety.
[11] DOCTOR: That's perfect, thank you, John.
[12] DOCTOR: Um, are you in a private place where you're OK to speak at the moment?
[13] PATIENT: I am, yes
[14] DOCTOR: OK, great.
[15] DOCTOR: So, um, tell me what's been going on.
[16] DOCTOR: You've been saying there's a problem with your hearing.
[17] DOCTOR: Is that right?
[18] PATIENT: Yeah, so I just feel I can't really hear as well as I used to, like my hearing is kind of deteriorating in some way.
[19] DOCTOR: Right, OK. How long has this been going on for?
[20] PATIENT: Uh about six weeks.
[21] DOCTOR: Six weeks, OK. Um, and before that have you had any hearing problem at all?
[22] PATIENT: Um I had something maybe, about a year ago, but it only lasted a couple of days, it wasn't anything as long as this.
[23] DOCTOR: Right, OK, OK. And, um, in this six week period, have you had anything else happen?
[24] DOCTOR: Have you had any other ear symptoms at all?
[25] PATIENT: Um, I occasionally get like a ringing in my left ear, uh just on the one side and um there's actually been a few times when I felt kind of a bit sick or a bit dizzy as well.
[26] DOCTOR: Right, OK.
[27] DOCTOR: Uh, uh, um, just to clarify, the difficulty you've got in hearing, is that both ears or just the left ear?
[28] PATIENT: Uh just the left ear, yeah.
[29] DOCTOR: Alright, so your right ear is fine.
[30] PATIENT: It seems be yeah.
[31] DOCTOR: OK.
[32] DOCTOR: So you've had ringing, difficulty hearing in your left ear, and feeling slightly sick.
[33] PATIENT: Mh-mm.
[34] DOCTOR: Um, that's been, on and off for the six weeks, or is it continuous there throughout that six weeks?
[35] PATIENT: Yeah.
[36] PATIENT: Uh it's kind of on and off.
[37] PATIENT: Like some things trigger it as well.
[38] PATIENT: So, for example, if I'm watching TV or listen to music or something that'll solve the ringing in the ear.
[39] DOCTOR: Right, OK. Um, and, um, have you had any pain from the ear at all?
[40] PATIENT: Uh no my left ear.
[41] DOCTOR: OK. Any discharge coming out of the ear?
[42] DOCTOR: No, OK. Um, have, have you been experiencing any fever?
[43] PATIENT: Uh, not specifically apart from the dizziness so much.
[44] DOCTOR: Right, OK. And, um, has your ear been itchy at all?
[45] DOCTOR: OK. Now, do you use cotton ball buds to try and clean out wax from your ears?
[46] PATIENT: Uh nah I'll do it.
[47] DOCTOR: No, OK. Well, you're right, you should, you shouldn't be doing that.
[48] DOCTOR: Doesn't clean up wax, it pushes it back in.
[49] DOCTOR: Alright, um, the first thing that we need to do is we need to get someone to have a look inside your ear.
[50] DOCTOR: 'K.
[51] DOCTOR: I'm just exclude the simple things.
[52] DOCTOR: Simple things might be wax.
[53] DOCTOR: You know.
[54] DOCTOR: Someone might have impacted wax, blocking the tube going into the eardrum, which can
[55] PATIENT: OK.
[56] DOCTOR: lead to muffled hearing.
[57] DOCTOR: Um, if that's the case, that that's something that's easy fixable.
[58] DOCTOR: But, um, so we need to exclude that first.
[59] DOCTOR: and then after that, we can consider other potential possibilities.
[60] DOCTOR: Um, and for that we need to have a look inside the ear drum.
[61] DOCTOR: So, um, what I think we could do is, um, maybe if we book you in for a face-to-face appointment in one of our clinics.
[62] DOCTOR: It's not an emergency.
[63] DOCTOR: It can be done within the next four, five days or so, OK?
[64] DOCTOR: And then, um, what I'll do, I'll send a message to our admin team.
[65] DOCTOR: I'll ask them to slot you into the clinic, one of our clinics in that time frame.
[66] DOCTOR: You can come in and one of the GPs will just have a quick look in the ear and figure out
[67] DOCTOR: whether there's physical blockage or whether there's something else going on, OK?
[68] DOCTOR: Um, can I just double check, the dizziness that you've been getting, um, how severe is it?
[69] PATIENT: OK.
[70] PATIENT: Yeah.
[71] PATIENT: Uh nothing major it's just kind of uh it's, it's not the kind of dizziness you get with nausea, like uh not, not proper room spinning or anything like that but just, just a little bit kind of off balance.
[72] DOCTOR: Right, right, OK. Have, have you had any chest pain with it?
[73] PATIENT: No.
[74] DOCTOR: No.
[75] DOCTOR: Any palpitations, heart beating fast?
[76] DOCTOR: OK, fine, alright.
[77] DOCTOR: Um, so let's get your ear checked out.
[78] DOCTOR: I think that will be the, the most sensible thing to do.
[79] DOCTOR: And then after that, we can, we'll be a step closer to figuring out which way we
[80] DOCTOR: It might be that there's a problem inside the drum or the balance system within the ear.
[81] DOCTOR: But, we just need to exclude whether there's
[82] DOCTOR: physical blockage first and trying to deal with that if that's the case, OK?
[83] DOCTOR: Um, but
[84] PATIENT: is that the sort of thing that can cause uh like this uh ringing I've got in my ear, 'cause it seems .
[85] DOCTOR: The ringing that you got, that you've got, it's something called Tinnitus.
[86] DOCTOR: OK?
[87] DOCTOR: Um
[88] PATIENT: Right.
[89] DOCTOR: and Tinnitus is something actually that medicine doctors, we don't really understand it fully.
[90] DOCTOR: We haven't
[91] PATIENT: OK.
[92] DOCTOR: Uh, people can't give you a specific cause for why some patients get Tinnitus and some patients don't.
[93] DOCTOR: It can be triggered by a wide range of different things, and in fact
[94] DOCTOR: I'm glad that you've mentioned that.
[95] DOCTOR: What I might do, in the time between now and when you come for the appointment, I'm going to, uh, put
[96] DOCTOR: paste the link for a leaflet about Tinnitus, um, in the notes for this appointment.
[97] DOCTOR: I'd really appreciate it if you could start reading about it.
[98] PATIENT: OK.
[99] PATIENT: Sure.
[100] DOCTOR: OK. And often that, that, uh, awareness of what it is and what the treatment options are, and there are limited options
[101] DOCTOR: um that helps us in terms of conversation about what we do next, if your ear is clear, OK?
[102] DOCTOR: So, um, I'm going to paste a link to that, um, and you can read about that and
[103] DOCTOR: what we'll do is we'll see you in about four, five days time.
[104] DOCTOR: It won't be with me, it'll be another GP
[105] DOCTOR: but they'll have my notes and they'll know exactly what, what my question is, which is just to check your ears.
[106] DOCTOR: Is that OK?
[107] PATIENT: OK.
[108] PATIENT: Yeah it sounds great.
[109] DOCTOR: Alright, great.
[110] DOCTOR: So, um, bear with me five minutes and then you can ring the support team, I'll leave the number in the notes for this appointment.
[111] DOCTOR: Ring them, and then they'll slot you in, OK?
[112] PATIENT: OK brilliant.
[113] DOCTOR: Alright.
[114] DOCTOR: If there's any problem, any issues between now and when the clinic appointment is, just book another appointment and you can speak to one of us over video, OK?
[115] PATIENT: OK.
[116] DOCTOR: Alright then.
[117] DOCTOR: Take care.
[118] DOCTOR: Nice to see you this morning.
[119] DOCTOR: OK. Bye bye.
[120] PATIENT: Thank you.
[121] PATIENT: See you later.assistant

[26] PATIENT: no no not not anything that i'm aware of
[27] DOCTOR: okay if it's okay with you i'm gon na do a quick physical exam your vital signs look good today blood pressure of one twenty four over seventy six heart rate of seventy respiration rate of sixteen o2 sat on room air of ninety eight percent and you are afebrile so you do n't have a fever today i'm gon na take a quick listen to your lungs here your lungs are clear and equal bilateral when i listen to them or when i auscultate your lungs now listening to your heart regular rate and rhythm no clicks rubs or murmurs and i do n't appreciate any extra beats doing a quick extremity exam your skin is pink warm and dry i do n't appreciate any edema to your lower extremities it looks like you do have a little bit of swelling to to your knuckles there on your third digit on each hand which can be normal for somebody who has ra however pulses are intact in all extremities and capillary refill is brisk so a quick review of your results now you had a chest ct before you came in to see me and the results of that chest ct do show a solitary two centimeter nodule in the lateral aspect of the right upper lobe now it appears the nodule is smooth in appearance and no evidence of any type of emphysematous disease is present which is good now for my assessment and plan for you so you do have an incidentally found right upper lobe lung nodule i'm going to order some pft which is pulmonary function test i just wan na get a check and and a baseline for your lung function i'm also going to schedule a pet ct this is gon na help to determine if that nodule is metabolically active meaning if it lights up it it can suggest that it's cancer or inflammatory i'm going to go ahead and suggest that we do remove this during or via video assisted thoracoscopy which means it's just gon na be three small incisions made on the side of your right chest i'm gon na go in with a camera and a scope and we'll remove that along with a very small portion of your lung you're gon na be under general anesthesia and it'll take about an hour and a half or so post procedure you're gon na be admitted and you will have a chest tube in until the following day and i'm gon na go ahead and take that out then at bedside most likely you're gon na be in the hospital for one night and go home the next day it could be a benign nodule but because your smoking history i really do think it's gon na be best that you have that removed now for your secondary concern of your rheumatoid arthritis i want you to continue to follow up with your rheumatologist and continue your medication therapy as has been previously outlined for you now do you have any questions comments or concerns before before we get the paperwork signed to start the the treatment process

[4] PATIENT: yeah i was up on a ladder painting and kinda reaching out and fell took a fall and kinda braced myself but i i was painting
[5] DOCTOR: okay so it does sound like there might have been some direct trauma to that area now it says here that this happened about three weeks ago were you able it sounds like you were able to get up and continue but you were having some pain did you take anything at that time to help with that shoulder pain
[6] PATIENT: yeah i i iced the arm and then i also i also took some advil
[7] DOCTOR: okay now have you had any shoulder pain before of that right shoulder or is this the first time or or the first insult to that area
[8] PATIENT: first time
[9] DOCTOR: okay and now are you able to move that right arm for me
[10] PATIENT: yes i'm able to move but i do have some pain lifting overhead raising my arm overhead
[11] DOCTOR: okay alright now do you have pain all the time or does it come and go
[12] PATIENT: it is some pain is all the time but it some is intermittent
[13] DOCTOR: okay now i you mentioned that you had taken some ibuprofen for that pain now let's talk a little bit about your pain rating okay zero being none ten being the worst pain you've ever felt in your life can you rate your pain for me without any tylenol or advil or any nsaid can you rate your pain for me
[14] PATIENT: about a six
[15] DOCTOR: okay now when you take that medication can you rate your pain for me what what's that pain level get to
[16] PATIENT: it goes down to about a four
[17] DOCTOR: okay so it does help take the edge off of that pain and and you're able to kinda move around a little bit then
[18] PATIENT: yes
[19] DOCTOR: okay so the remodel tell me a little bit about that my wife and i were working on our remodel and we went they just built the brand-new lowe's here in town have you guys been there yet
[20] PATIENT: no we have not
[21] DOCTOR: well i did n't know if you know this or not but you can save big money there that's the rumor
[22] PATIENT: okay
[23] DOCTOR: so yeah we we've been down there we got some pain we we got went and got some samples and then hey while we were there we ended up deciding to put down a bunch of flooring too so i really recommend you guys if you get a chance go over there and take a look at their sales and and see if you ca n't finish your remodeled project
[24] PATIENT: that sounds great i'll have to take a look at the flooring as well
[25] DOCTOR: that sounds good so now just out of curiosity are you experiencing any numbness or tingling in in your arm or hand
[26] PATIENT: i did when i initially hurt it but i'm not no longer having any numbness or tingling
[27] DOCTOR: okay so a little bit about my physical exam i'm gon na do a quick physical exam on you today now your vitals look good but specifically on your right shoulder exam you do have limited active and passive range of motion and there is tenderness to the greater tuberosity of the humerus now there is no tenderness at your sternoclavicular joint and you do have good strong bilateral hand grips and on your neurovascular exam of your right arm you do have brisk capillary refill of less than three seconds and you do have equal and bilateral response to sensation and touch which is good now taking a look at your x-ray that we did when you came in today good news is that right shoulder x-ray reveals no fracture or bony abnormality mkay so let me tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan now i your symptoms are most likely due to rotator cuff tendinopathy i think that you've injured the tendons of the muscles that make up the shoulder so that i think that's that's why you are having the that shoulder pain i do wan na order an mri of that right shoulder just to make sure that nothing else is going on now i'm gon na refer you to physical therapy and that's gon na be about six to eight weeks now my patients are very successful with their pt and let's see how you do before we make the decision that we would do additional treatment such as a steroid injection to that shoulder i do want you to continue to take an nsaid if you can tolerate tylenol i want you to go ahead and take tylenol for that pain do you have any questions comments or concerns about our treatment plan
[28] PATIENT: no i think it sounds good ca n't wait to to get some relief

[6] PATIENT: no no trauma that i can think of at all
[7] DOCTOR: okay
[8] PATIENT: i do n't remember hitting it either
[9] DOCTOR: okay now have you ever had pain in that shoulder before
[10] PATIENT: you know i'm active and will have aches and pains here and there but nothing that some tylenol ca n't take care of
[11] DOCTOR: okay and and it's isolated to your left shoulder
[12] PATIENT: it is
[13] DOCTOR: okay are you able to move that left arm for me
[14] PATIENT: you know anytime i try reaching for something or lifting anything i have a lot of pain and i do n't even try to raise my arm over my head because that's it it really hurts
[15] DOCTOR: okay so now i wan na talk a little bit more about that pain are you having pain all of the time or does it wax and wane does it come and go
[16] PATIENT: it's all the time and if there is any pressure like when i try to sleep at night i ca n't even lay i'm a side sleeper and it i really gives me a hard time because i'm so uncomfortable so the pain is always there
[17] DOCTOR: okay so you ca n't lay on your left side at all
[18] PATIENT: i ca n't
[19] DOCTOR: alright now do you have that pain when you lay on your back as well or just on your left side
[20] PATIENT: i mean it's always there but when i sleep directly on it the pain goes up
[21] DOCTOR: okay now let's talk just briefly about your pain so if you have n't taken anything at all or have you been taking anything at all let's start with that have you been taking anything for the pain
[22] PATIENT: yeah i've been taking tylenol and i'll take two extra strengths tylenol every six to eight hours
[23] DOCTOR: okay
[24] PATIENT: and it does help take the edge off
[25] DOCTOR: okay that's good now without any tylenol what's your pain level
[26] PATIENT: without any tylenol i would say my pain is like a three
[27] DOCTOR: okay and then with tylenol with that
[28] PATIENT: i'm sorry i keep doing that without any tylenol my pain is like a seven and with tylenol it goes down to a two or three
[29] DOCTOR: okay that's good so the tylenol really does help you that that's a good thing

[40] DOCTOR: if your symptoms do n't improve we can then consider maybe like a steroid injection of that left shoulder which could hopefully get you some relief now do you have any questions comments or concerns about our treatment plan
[41] PATIENT: yeah so i'm really active so do you think that this pain will ever go away
[42] DOCTOR: i do i do believe that that pain is gon na go away many of my patients are successful with pt so we are gon na start with that take a conservative approach and see how you do
[43] PATIENT: okay alright
[44] DOCTOR: alright so i'm gon na have the nurse come in and get you some paperwork and i'll see you in about two about two weeks

[26] PATIENT: that scares me
[27] DOCTOR: it's it they they move pretty fast i'm not gon na lie alright so if you do n't mind i'm gon na go ahead and do my my physical exam i'm gon na be calling out some of my findings but if you have any questions go ahead stop me let me know but i will be explaining along the way okay
[28] PATIENT: okay
[29] DOCTOR: alright so i've looked at your vitals and honestly they look great you know your blood pressure i see is one twenty five over seventy that's almost textbook respiratory rate we are seeing you at a smooth eighteen excuse me your temperature you're running normal ninety seven .
[30] DOCTOR: one you're you're satting at a hundred percent so and then your pulse so that's interesting like you're you're going at like about sixty beats a minute so i think they're i think we're doing pretty well i'm gon na go ahead and listen to your heart on your heart exam i do n't appreciate any like murmur rub or gallop we have a nice regular rate and rhythm for your lung exam i do appreciate a little bit of stridor that's really interesting but i do n't hear any wheezes or rales so that's great for your i know this sounds weird but for your abdominal exam i do n't appreciate any rebound no guarding on your skin exam i do n't sorry like on your your head everything looks symmetrical your your mucosal membranes are normal you do n't feel hot to touch so that's great but i'm gon na do my foot exam okay so on the right foot there is some bruising of the plantar and dorsal aspects of the foot there is associated swelling when i touch on your midfoot here does it hurt
[31] PATIENT: no uh uh
[32] DOCTOR: okay alright tenderness to palpation of the midfoot and positive piano key test of the first and second metatarsals alright it's also warm to touch alright so on your neurovascular exam of your right foot your capillary refill is less than three seconds strong dorsalis pedis pulse and your sensation is intact to light touch your left foot exam is normal capillary refill is appropriate pedal pulses are strong and sensation is intact so i know that before here we before i came in that we got an x-ray so i've reviewed the results of your x-ray of your right foot and it showed subtle dorsal displacement of the base of the second metatarsal with a three millimeter separation of the first and second metatarsal bases and the presence of a bony fragment in the lisfranc joint space alright i know those were a bunch of fancy words so now i'm gon na explain to you what that all means for my impression and plan your first problem is right foot pain consistent with a lisfranc fracture which is a fracture to one of your second metatarsal bones near the top of your foot right so the big part of your toe is the first metatarsal the second part where you can kinda like bend it right that's the that's the metatarsal that we're talking about based on your exam and what i'm seeing on your x-ray i am gon na recommend surgery for your foot the surgery will help place the bones in their proper positions using plates and screws to help prevent further complications there are also many ligaments at the top of your foot so i will be ordering an mri to further assess the fracture and any injury to the ligaments i know this is a lot do you have any questions
[33] PATIENT: yeah do i have to do the surgery
[34] DOCTOR: so i'm recommending it as there can be significant complications to your foot if you do n't it can lead to poor bone alignment or poor ligament healing which can lead to you losing the arch of your foot and becoming flat-footed you can also develop arthritis in that foot so yes i i i highly recommend it if you want to be able to walk and move about in a way that you are familiar with
[35] PATIENT: i just hate that word surgery doc
[36] DOCTOR: i know
[37] PATIENT: you know it scares me every time i mean especially with my foot i want to be able to walk again and so i just get really worried i mean how long is the procedure usually too
[38] DOCTOR: so it's actually
[39] PATIENT: have to be in the hospital
[40] DOCTOR: no no no no no it's actually a day surgery and you'll be able to go home the same day and then you will follow up with me here in the clinic in about a week you'll be in a cast and you will use crutches as you will not be able to use that foot for six to eight weeks after that you'll start gradually walking on your foot based on how you do so the procedure itself is not very long you will and so like since you will be able to go home that's great but you wo n't be able to drive especially since you're saying are you left handed or right handed
[41] PATIENT: i'm right handed
[42] DOCTOR: yeah so your your right foot is probably your dominant one and the also the one you're supposed to drive with so no you're gon na you're gon na need somebody to take you home but what
[43] PATIENT: i mean
[44] DOCTOR: uh uh
[45] PATIENT: does that mean i'm out for the rest of the season i mean i wan na be able to get back and play again i really am i'm getting a little better so i
[46] DOCTOR: mm-hmm
[47] PATIENT: i really wan na keep on playing my tennis with my friends but
[48] DOCTOR: yeah so unfortunately yes it does mean that you're out for the rest of the season but hopefully we can get you a great get you to a set up well for next season and in the meantime i think i'm gon na recommend after surgery that we get you to physical therapy i think that that's gon na be a really great way to like kinda strengthen the muscles and make sure that you're at peak performance before we put you back out there
[49] PATIENT: i suppose so
[50] DOCTOR: yeah
[51] PATIENT: okay
[52] DOCTOR: alright
[53] PATIENT: thank you
[54] DOCTOR: no problem so i do wan na let you know that there are some risks associated with any kind of surgical procedure i'm gon na bring you some paperwork and that my ma is gon na go over with you such as like risks of bleeding loss of sensation nerve damage all those things will be discussed with you and if you have any questions leading up to and even after your procedure go ahead and ask them and we'll be more than happy to help with that okay
[55] PATIENT: okay
[56] DOCTOR: alright
[57] PATIENT: good
[58] DOCTOR: thank you

[112] DOCTOR: Uh, you said you're eating OK?

[116] PATIENT: Uh, not that I can think of, um, may have been a bit stressed out at work, that kind of thing, but .
[117] DOCTOR: Yeah.
[118] DOCTOR: Um, well that would be the first thing to do, is to take some anti-inflammatories along with the Paracetamol.
[119] DOCTOR: Make sure you're really well hydrated.
[120] DOCTOR: Um, and, see how that goes, and if it, if it isn't settling, or it's getting worse, or you get any other change in your headache.
[121] DOCTOR: Um, or you're unwell with it, with a high temperature, then we would certainly need to speak to you.
[122] DOCTOR: Straight away about that.
[123] DOCTOR: The other thing is if you, if you're getting persistent, um, headaches, or headaches associated with your menstrual cycle, or certain things seem to trigger these headaches.
[124] DOCTOR: Then, it, it would be worth, having a further discussion about it, to see whether we can, work out if we can help the, that longer-term.
[125] PATIENT: OK, brilliant, thank you.
[126] DOCTOR: Um, I would, try and arrange to get your blood pressure checked, if you haven't had it checked for a while.
[127] DOCTOR: Uh, and, thing to do is to have a thermometer at home, so you can make sure that your temperature's OK.
[128] PATIENT: OK, sure.
[129] PATIENT: Yep.
[130] DOCTOR: If you have a raised temperature or, your headache's just getting worse, or you develop any rashes or anything like that.
[131] DOCTOR: Then we'd need to speak to you straight away.
[132] PATIENT: Yep, OK, that's brilliant.
[133] PATIENT: OK, so I'll take some Ibuprofen and I'll um, hopefully, be a bit better in a day or two then, so yeah.
[134] DOCTOR: OK, so, have you got any other questions?
[135] PATIENT: Uh, no, that was it today.
[136] DOCTOR: OK. OK then, we'll, we'll, we'll, um, speak to you again.

[82] DOCTOR: Um, and does the pain come and go?

[96] PATIENT: No.
[97] PATIENT: Like I said, I only take, um, vitamins.

[113] DOCTOR: OK.
[114] DOCTOR: And who do you live with at home?
[115] PATIENT: I live with my brother and my mum.
[116] DOCTOR: OK. OK.
[117] DOCTOR: And, um, have you tried anything yourself for this problem?
[118] PATIENT: Well, I've tried a home remedy.
[119] PATIENT: Um, I've tried the, the, uh, ORS, you know, thing I bought from my, my local, my local, uh.
[120] PATIENT: Um.
[121] DOCTOR: What?
[122] DOCTOR: Could you just repeat that?
[123] PATIENT: The ORS, the, the salt sugar ORS, um, um, mix, the salt sugar mix.
[124] DOCTOR: OK. And how often have you been taking that?
[125] PATIENT: Yeah.
[126] PATIENT: I've taken that, I've taken that, like, um, three times a day for the past two days.
[127] DOCTOR: OK. Um, and do you feel like your symptoms are easing off, or getting worse, or ?
[128] PATIENT: I, I, I they're not getting any better, 'cause like I said, I've been, I've been vomiting literally everything I take, so, so I doubt that even that had, had the chance to work.
[129] DOCTOR: Yeah.
[130] DOCTOR: OK.
[131] DOCTOR: Um.
[132] DOCTOR: I mean, it sounds like, because your brother's had a similar thing, it sounds like it might be some, an infectious gastroenteritis that you've got, which is usually caused by a virus.
[133] DOCTOR: But, it can be from something you've eaten, as well.
[134] DOCTOR: Um.
[135] DOCTOR: If the symptoms, they do normally start to settle by themselves with the oral rehydration salts.
[136] DOCTOR: Um, if the symptoms are continuing to get worse, the key thing is that we want to make sure that you're hydrated enough.
[137] DOCTOR: Um, sometimes you do require certain medication to help this, if it's, sometimes if it's caused by a bacteria.
[138] DOCTOR: Um, what I would say, probably worth as it's been going on for a few days and you feel like it's not starting to ease off.
[139] DOCTOR: I think it's probably important to get a sample of the stool, so we can make sure that you haven't got a nasty bacterial infection which needs specific treatment.
[140] PATIENT: OK.
[141] DOCTOR: Um, and we should also check that you're not getting dehydrated, because if you're, if you're not keeping fluid down, then you can get dehydrated.
[142] DOCTOR: Um, so.
[143] PATIENT: So, how, how do I, how do I get myself hydrated when I'm not able to even, like, drink water?
[144] PATIENT: I'm throwing up everything.
[145] DOCTOR: Yeah.
[146] DOCTOR: So you need to carry on with your rehydration salts, and just have very small amounts.
[147] DOCTOR: It's a positive sign that you passed urine an hour ago.
[148] DOCTOR: So, you're obviously still, um, hydrated enough to pass urine.
[149] PATIENT: OK.
[150] DOCTOR: But we, um, we should see you so that we can check your hydration and, um, get that sample sent off as soon as possible.
[151] DOCTOR: 'cause if, if, if you come into the clinic, you can send that sample off straightaway.
[152] DOCTOR: Otherwise, we would have to post it out to you which would take time.
[153] PATIENT: OK.
[154] PATIENT: Ohh, OK.
[155] PATIENT: So, when can I come to the clinic to have this done?
[156] DOCTOR: Um, so we can, we can make you an urgent appointment, um, and then you can, you can get the sample sent off and we can check your hydration.
[157] DOCTOR: Um, but if, in the meantime, you're feeling more unwell, then we would get you seen urgently in A and E.
[158] PATIENT: OK.
[159] DOCTOR: So you can call us back in the meantime.
[160] PATIENT: OK.
[161] PATIENT: So, what I'll do is, yeah.
[162] PATIENT: If you could, please book me the appointment and, um, yeah, I'll see how I feel, um, for the end of the day.
[163] PATIENT: Hopefully I don't need to go to the A and E, and, um .
[164] DOCTOR: Yeah.
[165] DOCTOR: If you keep drinking, keep going with the rehydration salts.
[166] DOCTOR: Just tiny sips constantly, to so that your stomach doesn't get overfilled and, and you vomit, so just tiny, tiny sips but just keep going with it.
[167] DOCTOR: Um, and just have very simple food, if you're gonna have anything, like toast or biscuit or something really light like that.
[168] DOCTOR: Avoid, um, fruit, vegetables, uh, milk, anything like that, which might just make it worse.
[169] PATIENT: Mm-hmm.
[170] PATIENT: OK.
[171] DOCTOR: OK.
[172] DOCTOR: So you'll have to book an appointment through the support line.
[173] PATIENT: OK.
[174] PATIENT: Yes, please.
[175] DOCTOR: Right, OK. We'll do that for you.
[176] DOCTOR: OK, take care.
[177] PATIENT: Thank you.
[178] DOCTOR: Thanks, bye.assistant

[1] DOCTOR: good afternoon alexis i understand you're having some issues with your hand
[2] PATIENT: yes i sit at the keyboard all day long and recently i've been having some numbness and tingling in my right hand
[3] DOCTOR: okay how long has that been going on
[4] PATIENT: i do n't know probably on and off for six months but over the last month or so it's been a little more persistent
[5] DOCTOR: okay okay and when does that numbness and tingling do you get a lot of pain with it first let me ask that question
[6] PATIENT: some pain
[7] DOCTOR: some pain
[8] PATIENT: mostly when i'm actually typing on the keyboard is when i experience the pain
[9] DOCTOR: okay
[10] PATIENT: but the numbness and tingling is all the time now
[11] DOCTOR: okay and when you get this pain what makes it better is it stopping and just resting for a while or do you take medications or try other
[12] PATIENT: i've been taking ibuprofen so ibuprofen and seem like not typing on the keyboard helps the most
[13] DOCTOR: okay
[14] PATIENT: the other thing that makes it hurt is my mouse
[15] DOCTOR: your mouth okay
[16] PATIENT: wow
[17] DOCTOR: yeah when you're moving that around okay
[18] PATIENT: yeah
[19] DOCTOR: does this pain ever wake you up in the middle of the night or the pain or the tingling
[20] PATIENT: no
[21] DOCTOR: no okay
[22] PATIENT: not affecting my sleep hmmm
[23] DOCTOR: okay so and you're using motrin for for ibuprofen for for the pain well let me go ahead and take a take a look here at your is it both hands or just your right hand
[24] PATIENT: mostly my right hand
[25] DOCTOR: mostly your right hand okay so let's go ahead and take a look at that right hand when i bend your wrist does that cause any pain
[26] PATIENT: yes
[27] DOCTOR: it does okay and so you do have some pain on extension and if you pull your your hand wrist up towards you does that cause the pain also
[28] PATIENT: yes
[29] DOCTOR: yeah okay so you do have pain on flexion and extension and when i touch the fingertips here now you said you had some numbness in your thumb and your index finger and a little bit in your your middle finger the other two fingers they feel okay or do you think that there is different than the other hand
[30] PATIENT: yeah for some reason it really is just that the thumb the pointer in the middle finger that i experience the most symptoms with
[31] DOCTOR: okay
[32] PATIENT: not why that is
[33] DOCTOR: okay so i i want you to grip my hands here and just squeeze tight okay so you do have a a little bit of a less grip strength on the right and that's typical that we would see with this type of pain and and numbness that you have going on now i want you to turn your arm over for me and i'm gon na touch on or tap on the inside of your wrist or or forearm and when i do that i can see your face you're grimacing so that that that must cause that shooting pain yeah okay so you do have a positive tinel's sign so in alexis what i think is going on is that you have a a carpal tunnel syndrome and we see that frequent
[34] PATIENT: i was afraid of
[35] DOCTOR: yeah you see this frequently but people who are doing data entry spend a lot of time on keyboards or you know some a lotta manufacturing people who do a repetitive procedure again and again will get that type of pain so here is my plan i'd like to put you in a splint and it's it's it's kind of a wrist splint i would like you to wear that at night that will help with that i want you to continue with the ibuprofens but i would like you to go up to six hundred milligrams four times a day and
[36] PATIENT: okay
[37] DOCTOR: we're gon na do that now i am going to order some a a outpatient test called an emg where we look at that nerve conduction study in that wrist and that's really what's happening here is you've got some thickening in the the in the wrist and the the the membranes of the wrist that are just pressing down and just compressing some of those nerves any other questions for me for now if that test comes back positive and we'll talk about that later on your next visit if it comes back positive we may have to do we're gon na stick with conservative treatment first but we may consider some surgery where i can go in and release that impingement on your nerves through your wrist it's a simple outpatient procedure and then i think you would feel better how does that sound
[38] PATIENT: that sounds like a good plan i was hoping maybe i could get some relief with some therapy rather than having to go to surgery so i like that plan very much
[39] DOCTOR: yeah we'll start with the the wrist splint and once i get the nerve conduction studies that will give me another idea whether or not i need to send you some physical therapy in addition or if we need to go directly to surgery but that will all hinge on that nerve conduction test do you so do you have any further questions
[40] PATIENT: no that's great thank you so much
[41] DOCTOR: thank you very muchassistant

[27] DOCTOR: okay if it's okay with you i'm gon na do a quick physical exam your vital signs look good today blood pressure of one twenty four over seventy six heart rate of seventy respiration rate of sixteen o2 sat on room air of ninety eight percent and you are afebrile so you do n't have a fever today i'm gon na take a quick listen to your lungs here your lungs are clear and equal bilateral when i listen to them or when i auscultate your lungs now listening to your heart regular rate and rhythm no clicks rubs or murmurs and i do n't appreciate any extra beats doing a quick extremity exam your skin is pink warm and dry i do n't appreciate any edema to your lower extremities it looks like you do have a little bit of swelling to to your knuckles there on your third digit on each hand which can be normal for somebody who has ra however pulses are intact in all extremities and capillary refill is brisk so a quick review of your results now you had a chest ct before you came in to see me and the results of that chest ct do show a solitary two centimeter nodule in the lateral aspect of the right upper lobe now it appears the nodule is smooth in appearance and no evidence of any type of emphysematous disease is present which is good now for my assessment and plan for you so you do have an incidentally found right upper lobe lung nodule i'm going to order some pft which is pulmonary function test i just wan na get a check and and a baseline for your lung function i'm also going to schedule a pet ct this is gon na help to determine if that nodule is metabolically active meaning if it lights up it it can suggest that it's cancer or inflammatory i'm going to go ahead and suggest that we do remove this during or via video assisted thoracoscopy which means it's just gon na be three small incisions made on the side of your right chest i'm gon na go in with a camera and a scope and we'll remove that along with a very small portion of your lung you're gon na be under general anesthesia and it'll take about an hour and a half or so post procedure you're gon na be admitted and you will have a chest tube in until the following day and i'm gon na go ahead and take that out then at bedside most likely you're gon na be in the hospital for one night and go home the next day it could be a benign nodule but because your smoking history i really do think it's gon na be best that you have that removed now for your secondary concern of your rheumatoid arthritis i want you to continue to follow up with your rheumatologist and continue your medication therapy as has been previously outlined for you now do you have any questions comments or concerns before before we get the paperwork signed to start the the treatment process
[28] PATIENT: no i do n't think so i think i'll be okay i'm scared
[29] DOCTOR: i i know you're scared but we'll be right here with you the whole way
[30] PATIENT: okay

[49] DOCTOR: then you're stuck with me okay i'm so sorry but here it's we're gon na try and make it as good as possible alright so last thing i do wan na do my physical exam alright and i need you to let me know as as much as you as much as you can verbalize right so when i push here in the middle of your neck on top of the bone does it hurt
[50] PATIENT: yes yes
[51] DOCTOR: okay alright sorry what about on the side does that hurt
[52] PATIENT: yes
[53] DOCTOR: okay so pain on palpation both on the bony process and on the muscle can you move your neck from side to side can you move your neck can you swive it side to side no no alright so i'm i'm seeing i'm seeing some range of movement moderate range of movement that's fine okay i so when can you bend your neck forward that that's your whole body just just the neck are you capable of bending up
[54] PATIENT: really hurts it really hurts
[55] DOCTOR: okay it really hurts to bend forward and backwards okay alright so i'm just gon na make a little note here i do n't i do n't see any bruising i'm not noticing any swelling there is i i do n't see any laceration what
[56] PATIENT: just sometimes it bruises
[57] DOCTOR: okay sometimes alright that's fine i i just i'm not seeing one here today so that's okay alright so with that being said i do wan na ask have you been experiencing any fatigue are you tired
[58] PATIENT: well since the accident yes
[59] DOCTOR: okay alright just making sure okay so this is what this is my assessment and plan this is what we are gon na do i want to be able to like we had you do an x-ray before you came in here and looking at it i'm not noticing any fracture that's a really good sign considering how many car accidents we've been in lately
[60] PATIENT: it hurts it hurts
[61] DOCTOR: absolutely no i we're gon na address the pain so for my first so looking at your imaging results though i'm not seeing a fracture that's a great sign so for your first diagnosis i'm gon na say that you have what is called a neck sprain that
[62] PATIENT: thinking are are you saying i'm thinking
[63] DOCTOR: no not by any means i am saying
[64] PATIENT: pain i have a lot of pain
[65] DOCTOR: yes and your pain can be explained by multiple things but thankfully it's not a broken neck is that okay
[66] PATIENT: yes
[67] DOCTOR: alright so what we are gon na do when we are gon na like try and treat this as conservatively as possible
[68] PATIENT: said it might be broken
[69] DOCTOR: what
[70] PATIENT: pamela said it might be broken
[71] DOCTOR: if pamela said it's broken then you know what this is what we're gon na do we're gon na order something called a ct that's gon na give us even nope you know what let's upgrade to an mri it's gon na give us the most thorough image of everything that's going on the heart and the soft tissues is that gon na is that so that way we can really get a good image of what's happening inside right
[72] PATIENT: okay because what the lawyer said i needed was an mri
[73] DOCTOR: not a problem we're we're gon na make your lawyer happy next step we are going to try working like from the outside in so i do need you to work on getting like you're you're saying you've seen some bruising and some swelling yourself so i want you to put ice on that whenever you're experiencing that in the moment when you wake up i want you to do your best to just like i'm gon na give you some exercises on the sheet and i want you to roll through these exercises every morning right to just get some like movement and like free frenosive movement back into your neck i also wan na put you on a couple medications now i know that you said you were on fentanyl before that's a bit extreme and i i want i i i wan na like monitor this a little more conservatively so what we're gon na start with is something called robaxin
[74] PATIENT: hurts a lot if i do n't get more fentanyl
[75] DOCTOR: you know we can refer you to pain medicine if it really is getting that complicated but for this current period we're gon na put you on some robaxin it's gon na be fifteen hundred milligrams and you're gon na take that six to eight hours every six to eight hours and that really should help kinda relax the muscles in the area take off some of that tension and really help with that pain if you're noticing that the robaxin still is n't helping maybe then we can start we can like start using like a heat pad or maybe some icyhot the biofreeze is a really good one to kinda help with that and then we will refer you to physical therapy i think with the mri we can start evaluating maybe some additional steps so rather than you having to like take that fentanyl because i do n't want you to be in danger right like people i do n't want you to get rubbed so what we could explore are local injections right and we can refer you to pain medication and see about like locally injecting the area and that should be able to help you out hopefully with this
[76] PATIENT: i ca n't go to work like this
[77] DOCTOR: okay so if it's if it's that bad let's wait for the mri result we're gon na give you off for work because you know you ca n't move and we'll see what the mri says about what whether or not we can get you like true local injections in the moment is that alright for now
[78] PATIENT: yeah
[79] DOCTOR: okay okay any other questions
[80] PATIENT: not right now
[81] DOCTOR: alrightassistant

[1] PATIENT: alright thanks for coming in today i see on my chart here that you had a bunch of lower respiratory infections so first tell me how are you what's going on
[2] DOCTOR: you know i'm doing better now but you know last week i was really sick and i just have had enough like i was coughing a lot a lot of mucus even had some shortness of breath and even a low-grade fever
[3] PATIENT: wow that is a lot so what did you do for some of those symptoms
[4] DOCTOR: you know i ended up drinking a lot of fluid and taking some robitussin and i actually got better over the weekend and now i'm feeling much better but what concerns me is that i i tend to get pneumonia a lot
[5] PATIENT: okay so when you say a lot like how frequently does it occur i would say it seem honestly it seems like it's every month or every other month especially over the past six six months that i just keep getting sick and i usually will end up having to go to my primary care doctor or
[6] DOCTOR: urgent care and i'll get prescribed some antibiotics and one time i actually ended up in the emergency room
[7] PATIENT: wow and how long do your symptoms normally last for
[8] DOCTOR: you know it could be as few as like a couple of days but sometimes it could go even up to a week
[9] PATIENT: mm-hmm you mentioned that you are a farmer did you do you notice that your symptoms occur while doing certain things on the farm
[10] DOCTOR: you know i was trying to think about that and i've been working on the farm for some time but the only thing i can think about is that i've been helping my brother out and i've been started like unloading a lot of hay which i do n't usually do and i wan na say that my symptoms actually start the days that i'm unloading hay
[11] PATIENT: alright do you wear a mask when you're unloading hay
[12] DOCTOR: no i do n't do that
[13] PATIENT: okay
[14] DOCTOR: none of us do
[15] PATIENT: okay yeah so like that your brother does n't either
[16] DOCTOR: no i'm the only one who seems to be getting sick
[17] PATIENT: alright so i know you said you were trying to like help out your brother like what's going on with him
[18] DOCTOR: you know we've just been getting really busy and so he has been working around doing other things so i've just been helping him just cover the extra load
[19] PATIENT: mm-hmm okay alright do you have any other siblings
[20] DOCTOR: yeah there is actually ten of us
[21] PATIENT: wow okay that's that's a lot of siblings
[22] DOCTOR: yeah i'm okay
[23] PATIENT: maybe maybe we could we could always stick them in they could get some work done the holidays must be fun at your place
[24] DOCTOR: yeah we do n't need to hire any i mean have anyone else this is our family
[25] PATIENT: you're right keep it in the family okay so speaking of family do you have do you or anyone have a history of seasonal allergies
[26] DOCTOR: no no i have never had any problems with allergies
[27] PATIENT: okay and do you smoke
[28] DOCTOR: i do n't smoke
[29] PATIENT: do you live with anybody who does
[30] DOCTOR: i do not
[31] PATIENT: okay alright so okay so now i i wan na go ahead and do my physical exam i'm gon na call out some of my findings just to make sure that i'm documenting everything and if you have any questions about what it is that i'm saying please feel free to ask okay
[32] DOCTOR: okay
[33] PATIENT: so i reviewed your vitals and you appear to be breathing a little fast your respiratory rate is twenty but but your oxygen is you're satting kind of fine at ninety nine percent on room air so i'm not too worried about that on for on your heart exam i do you have a regular rate and regular rhythm i do not appreciate any murmurs rubs or gallops on your lung exam you know i do you do have some fine rales on your lung exam but no wheezes and on your musculoskeletal exam i do not appreciate any clubbing of your fingers so for your results i did review the results of your chest x-ray and i noticed some round glass opacities so let me tell you a little bit about like my assessment and plan for your first problem of recurrent lung infections your symptoms seem consistent with a condition we call hypersensitivity pneumonitis in your case another name is farmer's lung which you know is appropriate considering your job this could be caused by bacteria and or mold that is found in the hay when you inhale it it leads to an allergic reaction in your lungs this is why your symptoms occur every time you move hay for your current symptoms i'm gon na prescribe you a a course of an oral steroid this will help to decrease the inflammation that is occurring in your lungs i will also be ordering a cat scan of your lungs which will help confirm the diagnosis as as well a pulmonary function test to assess how severe your respiratory impairment is it would be best if you could eliminate your exposure to the hay or prevent further to prevent further damage to your lungs however if you are unable it's very important that you wear a respirator when moving hay around i know that that was a lot of information i think it boils down to pull in more of your siblings to help work around but do you have any questions
[34] DOCTOR: yeah so is this gon na help so i do n't keep getting sick
[35] PATIENT: so ideally what we are doing i think this is the best course of action to deal with the deeper problem right of these infections and to kind of like clear up the pneumonia everything seems to hint on so what we're gon na do is treat your current infection we're going to either prevent you from being around hay or make it so that it's safe for you to be with hay and then we're gon na see like what we need to do moving forward does that help
[36] DOCTOR: okay it does
[37] PATIENT: alright
[38] DOCTOR: thank you
[39] PATIENT: okay no problem
[40] DOCTOR: alrightassistant

[1] PATIENT: Hi.
[2] DOCTOR: Hello.
[3] DOCTOR: Hi, I'm Doctor Jacob and welcome to Babylon.
[4] DOCTOR: Hello.
[5] DOCTOR: Hi.
[6] DOCTOR: So, um, just before we start, is it all right if you could confirm your name for me please?
[7] DOCTOR: And your date of birth?
[8] PATIENT: Sure, my name is Mary Smith.
[9] PATIENT: My date of birth is August sixteen, nineteen seventy six.
[10] DOCTOR: And your email address for me, please.
[11] PATIENT: My email address is Mary dot Smith at gmail dot com.
[12] DOCTOR: That's correct.
[13] DOCTOR: And just to confirm, that you're in a secure location, and we can have a confidential conversation.
[14] PATIENT: Absolutely.
[15] DOCTOR: Right.
[16] DOCTOR: So you've mentioned that you have some pain in your jaw.
[17] DOCTOR: Is that correct?
[18] PATIENT: Um, well.
[19] PATIENT: I think that's just, like, the first thing that I typed, but, uh, uh, it wasn't really what I, you know, I just typed it and then I clicked submit, so, that was uh, um.
[20] PATIENT: I mean it's part of the problem but I would say that, more of a problem for me, is that I can't quite move my left arm.
[21] PATIENT: I mean, I can move it but it's it's numb, and then I also feel some, like tingling in my fingertips.
[22] DOCTOR: OK, so numbness in the left arm, yeah?
[23] DOCTOR: How long has it been going on for?
[24] PATIENT: Yes, yes.
[25] PATIENT: So, I've started taking this boxing class.
[26] PATIENT: I've been taking this boxing class for a few weeks, and I feel like maybe, um
[27] DOCTOR: Mm hmm.
[28] PATIENT: It's probably been, I'd say, for at least two weeks, and it's kind of gotten worse.
[29] PATIENT: Like,in the beginning, I just kind of felt a little bit of a tingling.
[30] DOCTOR: Mm-hmm.
[31] PATIENT: and then it's gotten, it's gotten worse since then.
[32] PATIENT: Then the numbing kind of started I can feel it both in my, uh, um, you know a little bit in my elbow, and then in my arm, as well as in my hand
[33] DOCTOR: Mm-hmm.
[34] PATIENT: And now because it hasn't gotten better, I tried to get a massage, it's not better.
[35] PATIENT: Or, you know, try to take warm baths.
[36] PATIENT: It's not better, so I figured I'd call you and, and just figure out what's going on.
[37] DOCTOR: Right.
[38] DOCTOR: So, have you mentioned that message and a warm bath, any medications that you've taken so far?
[39] PATIENT: Uh, well it's.
[40] PATIENT: You know it's, it's numb and I, I kind of looked at stuff online, um, but you know I, I do take Ibuprofen because my muscles were sore, a little bit, and I've been taking this boxing class.
[41] DOCTOR: Uh huh.
[42] PATIENT: So, you know, I kind of hurt like my knuckles on my right hand.
[43] PATIENT: So that's been a little bit painful, so I've just kind of taken ibuprofen for that.
[44] DOCTOR: OK.
[45] PATIENT: But, like I said, I mean, I tried massage, I tried some hot baths, and that didn't help with this numbness thing.
[46] DOCTOR: Mmm.
[47] DOCTOR: Sure.
[48] PATIENT: I'm just kind of getting a little worried.
[49] DOCTOR: Of course.
[50] DOCTOR: So you just mentioned that your pain is from elbow downwards, is that, you know, the tingling, numbness elbow .
[51] DOCTOR: Not from your shoulder?
[52] PATIENT: And, um, well it's kind of funny, you know sometimes I will feel it in my shoulder.
[53] PATIENT: Like if I try to, if I try to like you know move like in boxing and stuff, I will even like, uh, um, maybe feel a little bit of, a little bit of pain.
[54] PATIENT: Uh, but I would say, if i'm just like resting if I'm sitting like, right now, I can feel like it's numb, and I, I actually feel, tingling right now, not in all of my fingers, just in some.
[55] DOCTOR: Yeah.
[56] DOCTOR: So, which fingers do you feel numb?
[57] PATIENT: OK, so it's my second, third, and fourth finger.
[58] DOCTOR: Uh huh.
[59] DOCTOR: Second, third and fourth finger.
[60] DOCTOR: And is it your palm side or, you know, the back of your hand side which is numb, or both?
[61] PATIENT: No.
[62] PATIENT: It's, it's the, it's this side.
[63] PATIENT: So, the front side.
[64] DOCTOR: It's the front side.
[65] DOCTOR: OK, right.
[66] DOCTOR: And have you been dropping things at all?
[67] DOCTOR: Like, you know, when you try to hold onto things, like a glass or something, have dropping it?
[68] PATIENT: Yes.
[69] PATIENT: So not so much with the glass, but I will say, um, well I play a little bit of a piano and so I just noticed it's been kind of harder to get the notes.
[70] DOCTOR: Mm-hmm.
[71] PATIENT: I can, I can grasp, I can grasp a a glass but because I use my right hand most of the time, you know, I'm not left handed so, it's kind of hard for me to.
[72] DOCTOR: So So you would say this in mind weakness, mind.
[73] DOCTOR: So just to get my facts right.
[74] DOCTOR: So you would say it's definitely weakness rather than because of the pain, you can't hold it.
[75] DOCTOR: That's two different things.
[76] DOCTOR: So you know sometimes you can't hold it because it's hurting you .
[77] PATIENT: Yes.
[78] PATIENT: Yeah.
[79] PATIENT: No, no, it's not hurting, it's not hurting, it's, like, numb, I can't feel it, right?
[80] PATIENT: Well, yeah.

[83] PATIENT: Yes, absolutely.
[84] PATIENT: No, not, no, nothing .
[85] DOCTOR: neck pain and all?
[86] DOCTOR: OK, right, OK.
[87] DOCTOR: So, just a bit more of a background because I don't have much information on the system.
[88] DOCTOR: Um, do you have any past, uh, medical history that you'd like to share?
[89] PATIENT: Mm hmm.
[90] PATIENT: Well, I guess because of this.
[91] PATIENT: You know, I'm not sure if it's boxing.
[92] PATIENT: I also had a really bad cold, like a month ago.
[93] DOCTOR: Mm-hmm.
[94] PATIENT: I mean, I was out, you know, drinking with, uh, friends, um, one of our co-workers just had his three year anniversary and
[95] PATIENT: We kinda went crazy and we were like out partying until, you know, late hours, and I just got uncharacteristically drunk for me.
[96] PATIENT: And then after that, I was sick for probably good like two weeks.
[97] PATIENT: I was at home.
[98] PATIENT: I think I must have had some kind of like a flu or something.
[99] DOCTOR: what
[100] DOCTOR: Mm-hmm.
[101] PATIENT: So it's that.
[102] PATIENT: And then, I'd say another weird thing that happened to me a few weeks ago, is like, I all of a sudden just couldn't see from the, uh, from my left eye.
[103] PATIENT: Like, I, I lost some, like a little bit of a field of vision
[104] PATIENT: Uh, and, but that, that just lasted not very long.
[105] PATIENT: I mean, that just lasted maybe for, I don't know, twenty, twenty minutes?
[106] DOCTOR: OK.
[107] PATIENT: Uh, and I kind of thought, I don't know maybe it was the the cold you know and the virus and all that so
[108] DOCTOR: Mm-hmm.
[109] PATIENT: I, I guess that's what I can, you know, that's the last thing I can remember, but in general, I'm, I'm pretty healthy.
[110] PATIENT: You know, I work out, uh, , and I, I don't really have any medical problems.
[111] DOCTOR: Yeah.
[112] DOCTOR: Do you have any headaches at all, from the, in the recent past?
[113] PATIENT: Um, sometimes I get headaches but I think they're just tired headaches.
[114] PATIENT: You know sometimes I'll get kind of
[115] PATIENT: Tired but I think that's probably because I work too much.
[116] PATIENT: Or, you know because like I'll go for a workout and then I'll really just exhaust myself and then I just kind of feel this fatigue.
[117] PATIENT: Uh, or sometimes like this morning for example, I just felt really, fatigued and I couldn't even get myself to the gym.
[118] PATIENT: But, you know, since I have this numbness it's kind of like, hard to workout right?
[119] DOCTOR: Hmm.
[120] DOCTOR: Do you wear glasses at all, glasses, contact lenses?
[121] PATIENT: No.
[122] DOCTOR: No, so no glasses .
[123] DOCTOR: And, you've not experienced anything like a seizure or a fit, anything like that?
[124] PATIENT: What's a seizure?
[125] DOCTOR: Like when you you lose consciousness and you start shaking.
[126] PATIENT: Ohh, no, no, no, no, nothing like that, mmm mmm.
[127] DOCTOR: OK, no fits, yeah, OK. And your weakness is only in your left arm.
[128] DOCTOR: Legs are walking and all this, normal, yeah?
[129] PATIENT: Right, exactly.
[130] PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, yeah, walking is normal, yeah.
[131] DOCTOR: You mentioned for a while you couldn't see, you know, the outside peripheral vision from your left eye.
[132] DOCTOR: How long did that episode last for?
[133] PATIENT: You know I think it was only maybe like twenty minutes or so.
[134] PATIENT: It's almost like it happened and I thought ohh my God.
[135] PATIENT: It's probably I'm still like sick from this, you know virus thing, cold, and so I just kind of slacked it off.
[136] PATIENT: And then when I, uh, um, when I woke up it was gone.
[137] DOCTOR: Sure, OK. Um, OK.
[138] DOCTOR: So is there any regular medications that you're using?
[139] PATIENT: Not really.
[140] PATIENT: I just take ibuprofen every once in a while, I take vitamin D. Um, I take some I, I like my my GP really wants me to take iron supplements, but you know, they're just like huge pills so I, I, most of the time I just forget.
[141] DOCTOR: OK.
[142] PATIENT: But, vitamin D I take.
[143] PATIENT: And then, sometimes I take Melatonin to help me sleep.
[144] DOCTOR: OK
[145] DOCTOR: Alright.
[146] DOCTOR: And any family history you'd like to share?
[147] DOCTOR: Any significant family history?
[148] PATIENT: I know that my dad has I don't know if it it's hypo, I think it's hypothyroidism.
[149] DOCTOR: Yeah.
[150] PATIENT: Um, and then my, like, he's got he's got some autoimmune stuff going on, like that much I know.
[151] DOCTOR: Mm-hmm.
[152] PATIENT: And then, my mom, my mom, she's actually not in a great shape.
[153] PATIENT: She's got diabetes type two.
[154] PATIENT: She's got hypertension, um, she's got, gosh, what is it, ohh, yeah, she's got high cholesterol, um, and I think that's it for her.
[155] PATIENT: Yeah.
[156] DOCTOR: Yeah, right.
[157] DOCTOR: Any neurological conditions in the family?
[158] PATIENT: Uh.
[159] DOCTOR: there are related conditions.
[160] DOCTOR: No, OK, that's fine.
[161] DOCTOR: OK, so, right.
[162] DOCTOR: So after, you know, speaking and examining, you know, yourself, I think it's quite important that we do investigate it a bit further.
[163] DOCTOR: I'm just wondering whether there's something a bit more than just the boxing here.
[164] DOCTOR: OK, few things that's, made me think other than, just like a boxing injury, is for instance, um, you know, when you said you can't, your vision went, your peripheral vision was not there for about twenty.
[165] DOCTOR: So, and that with the weakness of the arms, make me think, is there something else going on rather than just an injury?
[166] PATIENT: OK.
[167] PATIENT: What do you think may be going on?
[168] DOCTOR: sometimes you know you do get things like MS, multiple sclerosis.
[169] DOCTOR: So people with multiple sclerosis can have, um, visual problems, like what you've experienced and sometimes you know the odd numbness tingling sensations going on.
[170] DOCTOR: OK?
[171] PATIENT: Ohh!
[172] PATIENT: Ohh my God!
[173] PATIENT: Will I be in a wheelchair?
[174] DOCTOR: We, if we capture it a bit early there are treatments for it.
[175] DOCTOR: OK?
[176] DOCTOR: I'm not, obviously I'm not suggesting that you do have it, but it is quite important to find out that, whether you have it or not that's the most serious kind of thing that needs to be, uh, dealt with here.
[177] DOCTOR: Yeah.
[178] DOCTOR: So, what we can do is I'm going to do an urgent, very urgent neurology referral.
[179] DOCTOR: Yeah?
[180] DOCTOR: What they, what that might entail is the brain scan and things like that.
[181] DOCTOR: Hello?
[182] PATIENT: K, OK.
[183] PATIENT: OK
[184] PATIENT: I see.
[185] PATIENT: Yeah yeah yeah!
[186] PATIENT: Yeah, I'm here, I'm here.
[187] DOCTOR: I know this might sound a bit of a shock to you, um, but I'm, I think it is more important that we investigate this a bit more seriously.
[188] PATIENT: Yeah.
[189] PATIENT: Alright.
[190] PATIENT: Yeah, that makes sense.
[191] DOCTOR: OK. Any questions at all?
[192] PATIENT: Well, what's, OK, so you're gonna do the referral, um, should I be taking any drugs or, um
[193] DOCTOR: No, that's something we can't do.
[194] DOCTOR: The treatment for it is actually some steroids and things like that, uh, when you have an acute you know, acute reaction or things like that.
[195] DOCTOR: But, saying that, first we need to firm diagnosis.
[196] DOCTOR: Yeah.
[197] DOCTOR: While you're waiting for this to be done, if there's any weakness, uh, you know, if the weakness progresses to your legs, or there's any kind of headaches, vomiting, fits, and your visual symptoms are getting worse and not getting better, then that would be an A and E.
[198] PATIENT: Mm hmm, yes, OK.
[199] PATIENT: OK, got it.
[200] DOCTOR: Alright.
[201] PATIENT: Sounds good!
[202] PATIENT: OK, thank you, doctor.
[203] DOCTOR: Yeah.
[204] DOCTOR: I'm I'm sorry.
[205] DOCTOR: I, I do appreciate you are a bit worried, but, you know, it's good that we know that you've come and spoken to us today, and hopefully we'll get things sorted and the ball rolling.
[206] DOCTOR: OK?
[207] PATIENT: Thank you, doctor.
[208] PATIENT: Appreciate your time.
[209] DOCTOR: That's OK. You take care.
[210] PATIENT: Thank you.
[211] PATIENT: Bye bye!

[7] DOCTOR: okay that's good to hear you mentioned exercise and biking i love to bike myself i've got a track seventy one hundred hybrid have you been on the the new trails they opened it was the old the old rail the old rail road right away they've opened that up it's like sixty miles of trails
[8] PATIENT: i love that that road i just i i do n't like riding on the road so i prefer to do those rails the trails type
[9] DOCTOR: yeah
[10] PATIENT: and it's just so phenomenal i do that a lot
[11] DOCTOR: yeah i love riding over there way we will we will get you all fixed up we will have to go for a bike ride
[12] PATIENT: absolutely i'd love it
[13] DOCTOR: that'd be great so i see here on your medical history that you also have a history of rheumatoid arthritis is that under control at this time and and and what do you do to to take care of your ra
[14] PATIENT: yeah it's it's it's fair you know arthritis never really goes away but i take methotrexate
[15] DOCTOR: okay
[16] PATIENT: i think it's seven and a half milligrams every week and as long as i'm keeping active my joints feel okay and if i do have any problems it's it's mostly with my hands but i have n't had any recent flares so i'm okay right now
[17] DOCTOR: okay that's good i also see here that you marked down that you were a previous smoker and and when when did you when did you stop smoking
[18] PATIENT: i stopped smoking probably about seven years ago
[19] DOCTOR: okay
[20] PATIENT: and i was young and should have stopped the way before that my kids were on me all the time but you know i i got a new start and finally was able to stop and i felt better after stopping
[21] DOCTOR: okay that's good and i'm glad to hear that you were able to to to stop and and stay tobacco free that that's great to hear do you have any pain or any shortness of breath or anything like that
[22] PATIENT: no not at all
[23] DOCTOR: okay and i would like to talk about your familial history here for just a second do you have any family history of lung cancer or any other type of malignancies
[24] PATIENT: no lung cancer my mom did have breast cancer but she is doing well now
[25] DOCTOR: okay alright and then things like lung infections or pneumonia do you have any previous history of that
[26] PATIENT: no no not not anything that i'm aware of
[27] DOCTOR: okay if it's okay with you i'm gon na do a quick physical exam your vital signs look good today blood pressure of one twenty four over seventy six heart rate of seventy respiration rate of sixteen o2 sat on room air of ninety eight percent and you are afebrile so you do n't have a fever today i'm gon na take a quick listen to your lungs here your lungs are clear and equal bilateral when i listen to them or when i auscultate your lungs now listening to your heart regular rate and rhythm no clicks rubs or murmurs and i do n't appreciate any extra beats doing a quick extremity exam your skin is pink warm and dry i do n't appreciate any edema to your lower extremities it looks like you do have a little bit of swelling to to your knuckles there on your third digit on each hand which can be normal for somebody who has ra however pulses are intact in all extremities and capillary refill is brisk so a quick review of your results now you had a chest ct before you came in to see me and the results of that chest ct do show a solitary two centimeter nodule in the lateral aspect of the right upper lobe now it appears the nodule is smooth in appearance and no evidence of any type of emphysematous disease is present which is good now for my assessment and plan for you so you do have an incidentally found right upper lobe lung nodule i'm going to order some pft which is pulmonary function test i just wan na get a check and and a baseline for your lung function i'm also going to schedule a pet ct this is gon na help to determine if that nodule is metabolically active meaning if it lights up it it can suggest that it's cancer or inflammatory i'm going to go ahead and suggest that we do remove this during or via video assisted thoracoscopy which means it's just gon na be three small incisions made on the side of your right chest i'm gon na go in with a camera and a scope and we'll remove that along with a very small portion of your lung you're gon na be under general anesthesia and it'll take about an hour and a half or so post procedure you're gon na be admitted and you will have a chest tube in until the following day and i'm gon na go ahead and take that out then at bedside most likely you're gon na be in the hospital for one night and go home the next day it could be a benign nodule but because your smoking history i really do think it's gon na be best that you have that removed now for your secondary concern of your rheumatoid arthritis i want you to continue to follow up with your rheumatologist and continue your medication therapy as has been previously outlined for you now do you have any questions comments or concerns before before we get the paperwork signed to start the the treatment process

[1] DOCTOR: hi dennis how are you today
[2] PATIENT: good
[3] DOCTOR: so what what brings you into the office i do n't believe i have ever seen you before here
[4] PATIENT: the i'm training for a triathlon and the back of my heel hurts typically after a workout or when i first get up in the morning it will really hurt in the back of my heel all the way up into my calf
[5] DOCTOR: okay now tell me a little bit about this triathlon training what do you are you are you running far are you tell me kind of how you work out for that today
[6] PATIENT: i i will run about ten klometers
[7] DOCTOR: okay
[8] PATIENT: in the morning at lunchtime i try to get on the bike for about forty five minutes to an hour
[9] DOCTOR: okay
[10] PATIENT: and then in the evening i go to the aquatic center and i jump in the pool and swim for about another thirty minutes to an hour
[11] DOCTOR: wow that's that's a that's an aggressive campaign to get there so really hope you get that triathlon in so you're how many days a week does this occur that you're training
[12] PATIENT: i i do that five days a week on the weekends i kinda alternate between you know a long run and a long bike do n't really do a long swim but
[13] DOCTOR: okay
[14] PATIENT: i i just swimming on those other five days and i take one day off
[15] DOCTOR: okay on your running days or when you do the running tell me a little bit about your stretching routine do you are you aggressive stretchers you do not stretch at all i know people that do both
[16] PATIENT: yeah i do n't i do n't stretch at all i do n't have time for that
[17] DOCTOR: okay and i'm assuming that with the bicycle either you do n't really work the lower legs to get them stretched out you just jump on and go correct
[18] PATIENT: yeah
[19] DOCTOR: okay
[20] PATIENT: yeah you know i you know when i first start off i go slow until i'm warmed up and then i
[21] DOCTOR: okay tell me a little bit about the pain is you said it it's after the activity but it you when you first wake up in the morning it it's it's there also
[22] PATIENT: yeah when i first get out of bed it's just it just feels really tight and almost like it's tearing and i after i been walking around for about ten or fifteen minutes it eases up a little bit but if if i ever sit down for any extended period of time and then try to get back up it's really sore again
[23] DOCTOR: okay
[24] PATIENT: or
[25] DOCTOR: no go ahead go ahead
[26] PATIENT: or after a lot of activity it'll get sore too
[27] DOCTOR: okay okay i'm sure this is impacting that ability to to really focus on your training uh as you're going with that with that type of a pain so lem me go ahead and let's let's take a look at your your and your lower extremities here and yeah okay so roll up your pants yeah okay good now does your left leg hurt at all do you get that severe pain or is it mainly on the right
[28] PATIENT: no it's mainly just on the right
[29] DOCTOR: okay okay so i'm gon na just hold your leg here and i want you to take your your foot and ankle and i want you to go ahead and just pull your your toes up towards you does that create some pain when you do that
[30] PATIENT: yeah a little bit
[31] DOCTOR: a little bit okay now i'm just gon na hold your foot up and i want you to push against me and does that hurt
[32] PATIENT: yeah that hurts a little bit too
[33] DOCTOR: yeah okay okay roll over here on my my stretcher for me and i want you to dangle your your feet over the edge and what i wan na do is i just wan na i'm gon na squeeze your left calf first and when i do that does that hurt on your left side
[34] PATIENT: no
[35] DOCTOR: okay
[36] PATIENT: no
[37] DOCTOR: and i'm gon na squeeze on the right side anything there
[38] PATIENT: no
[39] DOCTOR: okay okay well that's good your your thompson test is negative that's a really good finding and i just wan na continue pressing here on your right from your heel when i squeeze your heel does that cause significant pain at all
[40] PATIENT: yeah
[41] DOCTOR: yeah okay and if i come up a little bit further as i i run up that achilles tendon does that hurt
[42] PATIENT: that's real tender
[43] DOCTOR: yeah okay okay great not great so yeah go ahead and sit up for me so dennis my diagnosis is achilles tendinitis and it's really from overuse when we see this frequently when somebody starts to you know get in and train aggressively for an event i'm unfortunately i'm gon na have to ask you to stop training for a a week or two i know that's concerning but i really want this to heal before we move into that next phase i did n't ask you about medication but i'm assuming whatever you were doing was n't working significantly so what i'd like you to do is take some ibuprofen or advil that's the same medication and i want you to take three tablets every six hours and that's really an anti-inflammatory see if we can eliminate some of that tendinitis type pain that you're getting that inflammation around that achilles tendon i'm gon na also order a couple physical therapy visits and the reason for that is i'd like you to get some strength and stretching understanding i think it's important for you especially here at the beginning is to get some of that real stretching knowledge in and learn how to stretch those muscles before you start these activities and they are gon na help strengthen your your lower extremities also and i want you to come back to me within you know a week to ten days following your first couple physical therapy appointments so i can monitor how you're doing i see no reason for an x-ray at this point but if this continues we're gon na you know if you're still having pain ten days in significant pain without change modification of your activity then we may have to look at more aggressive treatment plans how does that sound for you
[44] PATIENT: sounds good
[45] DOCTOR: okay hey did you happen to catch that pittsburgh pang one hockey game last night
[46] PATIENT: no i i was watching the track meet
[47] DOCTOR: my gosh the the pang ones are on fire you know they beat up on new york seven to two i mean the hockey's just an amazing sport i i just do you guy do you do a lot of hockey down there in town here
[48] PATIENT: used to when i lived in detroit
[49] DOCTOR: oh
[50] PATIENT: hockey town but not so much anymore
[51] DOCTOR: no yeah detroit is a hockey town yeah the red wings okay well i'm gon na go ahead and i'll send my nurse in and go ahead and get you discharged and like i said i'd like to see you back here in seven to ten days after that first physical therapy appointment i've got a great phenomenal office staff you just call in once that gets scheduled they will get you in to that next available appointment so take care and i will talk to you later

[59] DOCTOR: are you it's okay i'm your doctor i'm not here to judge you i just want to make sure that i'm like you know when the conclusions that we come to and like my assessment and plan for you i need to know this information so one more time do you smoke or have you smoked before
[60] PATIENT: okay i smoked
[61] DOCTOR: okay that's fine how much and how often and what was it
[62] PATIENT: i'm not telling you all that i'm just telling you i smoked

[64] PATIENT: too many questions are you the fit
[65] DOCTOR: i'm your doctor i have to
[66] PATIENT: are you the fence you sound like the fence next question
[67] DOCTOR: i'm not a op i promise alright that's fine but let me know are you currently like smoking
[68] PATIENT: no
[69] DOCTOR: okay okay i just have to ask alright so i do wan na do a quick physical exam i did review your vitals and like part of why i wan na know about your smoking history is that you are stating kind of low like it looks like you are might be in the ninety five percentile range and so we might need to explore some things
[70] PATIENT: sent them off yeah
[71] DOCTOR: pardon
[72] PATIENT: because i'm fat my cousin was fat too and and he gained a bunch of weight he he had to have oxygen
[73] DOCTOR: you know honestly there are a few other factors weight gain does n't necessarily help you're right but like smoking has like a stronger impact so but it's okay we can explore like you know other options here i as i listen to your heart you have a regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmur on so i'm gon na go ahead and do a back exam i do n't notice any overlying erythema or ecchymosis on your skin so no redness or bruising when i push here on your spine does that hurt okay okay so there is midline tenderness on the l4 l5 disk space with right sided lumbar paravertebral tenderness when you bend forward does it hurt
[74] PATIENT: yeah it hurts
[75] DOCTOR: okay and when you bend backward does it hurt
[76] PATIENT: a little bit
[77] DOCTOR: okay so pain with lumbar flexion and extension alright and as i raise your leg does this hurt when i raise your leg up
[78] PATIENT: stop
[79] DOCTOR: okay so supine straight leg test positive alright just a couple more things on neurological examination there is decreased sensation to light touch at the right lateral thigh at l4 dermatome patella and achilles reflexes are symmetrical so i just wanted to make sure that i documented all of that in your chart and in a you can ask me any questions but i did look over the results of the
[80] PATIENT: what does that mean like am i dying
[81] DOCTOR: no no no you're not dying but i think we have i think i have a good idea of what's causing your back pain so first let's talk about the mri that you had the results show a disk desiccation a disk bulge with parison paracentral disk herniation resulting in moderate right for neural foraminal stenosis okay
[82] PATIENT: that's a big word
[83] DOCTOR: those are huge words it's okay so let me tell you what like what all this means and what we're gon na do like for my assessment and plan so for your problem of chronic lumbar back pain based on your symptoms your exam and reviewing your mri that's consistent with a herniated disk at the l4 l5 with radiculopathy what this means is that one of your disks that sits between your spinal vertebrae is bulging out and this bulge is pinching on some nerves that's why you feel the tingling in your leg alright so that it's also why you felt pain when i pushed on that area so i'm gon na recommend some a spinal injection with a strong anti-inflammatory medication called a corticosteroid right i think you said that you had one before but i think this is something
[84] PATIENT: i had to have someone hold me down i do n't like needles so do you can i take a pill i do n't want that
[85] DOCTOR: we could yeah we could give you something to help calm down like the anxiety i would just write you a prescription for one and you would take that maybe three hours before you came in for your appointment and then you should feel calm enough to be able to do the injection
[86] PATIENT: okay
[87] DOCTOR: alright
[88] PATIENT: can i get pain pills too
[89] DOCTOR: can you
[90] PATIENT: for pain
[91] DOCTOR: can you get what now
[92] PATIENT: pain pills
[93] DOCTOR: so once i inject the cotocoid steroid in the in your spine it's gon na happen under fluoroscopy right and it's going to be it's a it's just a type of of like x-ray sorry to because i need to be very specific in where i do this injection so i say this because you should n't need anymore pain pills after we do this injection it should help with the inflammation and directly target the bulge to help you out so after this injection give it maybe a day and if you say that you're still experiencing pain then we can talk about maybe giving you pain medication but remember before you said it was n't as effective so i think this steroid shot is the best chance that we have
[94] PATIENT: i'd say it was n't effective
[95] DOCTOR: okay sorry i i i saw that they gave you strong pain meds but remember you said the white one did you say it was effective
[96] PATIENT: yeah i said i said the white ones i said they worked
[97] DOCTOR: okay i'm sorry so alright so maybe when let's okay so what we're still gon na do though we're gon na do the injection and then if it still hurts after that then we can explore that pain medication i do n't want you to have to consistently be on pain medication it's not necessarily like a good long term solution if after we monitor this you still are experiencing pain we are gon na try the pain meds however i would maybe recommend surgery
[98] PATIENT: i do n't want i know
[99] DOCTOR: right and so this is we're just gon na try everything that we can before you know before we get to that place
[100] PATIENT: mm-hmm
[101] DOCTOR: do you have any questions
[102] PATIENT: no
[103] DOCTOR: alright
[104] PATIENT: when it when is it when am i having this this when do you want me to get this injection
[105] DOCTOR: okay so you're gon na go to the front and schedule it this is a very quick and common procedure it should only take about an hour we will need to do this note like if this if this is successful we would only maybe do this four times a year so whenever at the front desk go ahead and schedule i think that mine pretty available to be able to help you with this alright any other questions
[106] PATIENT: no
[107] DOCTOR: okay thank youassistant

[1] DOCTOR: patient mrn : abc123 .
[2] DOCTOR: date of birth : january 1st , 1960 .
[3] DOCTOR: patient is a 60 year old , right-handed male , referred today for evaluation of numbness and tingling .
[4] DOCTOR: hello , mr. cook .
[5] DOCTOR: how are you doing this morning ?
[6] PATIENT: hi , dr. martinez .
[7] PATIENT: this weekend was a bit rough .
[8] PATIENT: i've had this numbness and tingling for a few weeks now .
[9] DOCTOR: so it's in both of your hands ?
[10] PATIENT: yes , ever since my car wreck last december when i broke them ... well , once they healed , i mean , i noticed it more , the tingling and the numbness .
[11] DOCTOR: and you still wear the splint only on the right wrist ?
[12] PATIENT: no , i also wear the left sometimes .
[13] PATIENT: the right is just worse , but the splint helps .
[14] PATIENT: both have really gotten worse over the last month .
[15] PATIENT: when i broke them , my right wrist was definitely in worse shape .
[16] PATIENT: i've also been having some s- mild stiffness in my neck too .
[17] PATIENT: i hit my head during the accident , and they told me it was a contusion .
[18] DOCTOR: and where would you say the tingling and numbness is ?
[19] PATIENT: on this side , it goes from here and here up to about here .
[20] PATIENT: on the other side , it's from here to here .
[21] DOCTOR: i see .
[22] DOCTOR: so on the right side , you're pointing from the middle and ring finger , all the way up the forearm .
[23] DOCTOR: and on the left , the symptoms extend from the pinky and ring finger .
[24] DOCTOR: and is there any pain or just tingling and numbness ?
[25] PATIENT: eh , it's mainly just sore .
[26] PATIENT: sometimes they throb , but overall , they feel weaker too , especially when i'm using them .
[27] PATIENT: the tingling happens more when they hurt , but when it goes away , the tingling is dull .
[28] DOCTOR: and when do you feel these symptoms ?
[29] PATIENT: well , really , i guess , just more so at night , and they come and go throughout the day .
[30] DOCTOR: okay .
[31] DOCTOR: and do you experience any loss of sensation in your hands or fingers ?
[32] PATIENT: like , feeling something ?
[33] PATIENT: no , not that i can really think of .
[34] PATIENT: though , in general , they may be less sensitive than they should be , but i can still feel .
[35] PATIENT: they also gave me some nerve pain medicine , but i have n't been taking it like i should .
[36] DOCTOR: and are you still on the coreg for hypertension and the lexapro for anxiety ?
[37] PATIENT: yes , i'm still taking those .
[38] PATIENT: i had prediabetes too , but i got it under control by changing my diet .
[39] DOCTOR: and no history of thyroid issues , correct ?
[40] PATIENT: nope .
[41] DOCTOR: all right , thank you , mr. cook .
[42] DOCTOR: okay , first , we'll go over your review of systems .
[43] DOCTOR: correct me if i'm wrong in any of this .
[44] DOCTOR: constitutional , you have fatigue and weight gain ; gi , you have excessive appetite and bloating ; eyes have floaters ; cardiovascular shows shortness of breath and leg swelling ; endocrine , you're always hungry ; skin , you have some nail bed changes , dryness , itching ; musculoskeletal , you have gout and muscle pain .
[45] DOCTOR: and the remainder of the review of systems is negative .
[46] PATIENT: yep , that's all correct .
[47] DOCTOR: all right , we're going to go ahead and do the neurologic examination .
[48] DOCTOR: let's look at the right hand first .
[49] DOCTOR: can you feel this ?
[50] PATIENT: yeah , but a little less on these two fingers .
[51] DOCTOR: sensation is normal , except pin prick sensation diminished in third and fourth fingers on the right .
[52] DOCTOR: and how about on the left ?
[53] PATIENT: um , yeah , but these two a little less .
[54] DOCTOR: sensation is decreased in the fourth and fifth fingers on the left
[55] DOCTOR: okay , let's test your reflexes now .
[56] DOCTOR: reflexes are 1+ and symmetric ; 2+ knees ; toes are downgoing bilaterally .
[57] DOCTOR: all right , i'm going to tap on your right wrist .
[58] DOCTOR: do you feel anything ?
[59] PATIENT: yeah , it feels like a zing up my wrist and something into my elbow too .
[60] DOCTOR: and how about the left side ?
[61] PATIENT: yeah , same on that side too .
[62] DOCTOR: tinel sign positive at both wrists and both elbows .
[63] DOCTOR: rest of exam is normal .
[64] DOCTOR: all right , so what i am seeing today is bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome or , potentially , this could also be bilateral cubital tunnel syndrome .
[65] DOCTOR: however , your symptom presentation suggests car- bilateral carpal syndrome , as the nerve in your wrists are aggravated by your past trauma .
[66] DOCTOR: this is causing the pain and tingling you were describing to me .
[67] PATIENT: okay , so how do we make it better ?
[68] DOCTOR: first , i want to determine exactly where the nerve irritation is coming from .
[69] DOCTOR: we'll need to schedule you for a nerve test , which is called an emg test .
[70] DOCTOR: they will measure the responsiveness of your nerves to truly pinpoint where you are having your issues .
[71] PATIENT: that sounds fine to me .
[72] DOCTOR: great .
[73] DOCTOR: after the tests are complete , you can return here for a follow-up visit .
[74] DOCTOR: if you're still having symptoms , we can consider a referral to our hand clinic , possibly for injections or carpal tunnel release se- surgery .
[75] DOCTOR: you could also refer ... we could also refer you to an orthopedist for the same treatment .
[76] PATIENT: sounds good , doc .
[77] DOCTOR: all right , keep wearing your splints , and i will see you after those studies .
[78] PATIENT: thank you .assistant

[1] DOCTOR: next patient is emily hernandez .
[2] DOCTOR: date of birth , march 26 2001 .
[3] DOCTOR: this is a 20 year old female being seen today for our yearly follow-up for asthma , allergic rhinitis and food allergy .
[4] DOCTOR: due to insurance changes since our last office appointment in april 2020 , she was switched from symbicort to wixela .
[5] DOCTOR: she also uses zyrtec in the spring , summer and fall for her seasonal allergy symptoms , which tend to work well .
[6] DOCTOR: she also has known peanut allergy , she does tolerate almonds and cashews .
[7] DOCTOR: please put in the asthma section at the very bottom that the act score is 21 .
[8] DOCTOR: please put under interval history , written consent is obtained today to use dax for documentation .
[9] DOCTOR: hi emily , how are you ?
[10] PATIENT: i'm pretty good , how are you ?
[11] DOCTOR: i'm good , thank you .
[12] DOCTOR: so gosh , we last talked a little bit over a year ago and it was just a telemedicine visit , but it seems like you've been doing pretty good .
[13] DOCTOR: i know there was an insurance change .
[14] DOCTOR: i think you had switched over to wixela , is that right ?
[15] PATIENT: yep , that's right , and it's what i'm currently using .
[16] DOCTOR: okay , and that's the 250/50 dose , correct ?
[17] PATIENT: yes , correct .
[18] DOCTOR: perfect .
[19] DOCTOR: so how does that compare ?
[20] PATIENT: i mean , it's working well .
[21] PATIENT: i really have n't had any issues with it and i take it once in the morning and once at night .
[22] DOCTOR: and that's one puff twice a day ?
[23] PATIENT: mm-hmm .
[24] DOCTOR: okay .
[25] DOCTOR: and have you been having to use your albuterol inhaler at all ?
[26] PATIENT: rarely , and if i do it's really just before a workout or something out that , if i know i'm really going to be pushing it .
[27] DOCTOR: so it sounds like it's around strenuous activity .
[28] PATIENT: yes .
[29] DOCTOR: okay .
[30] DOCTOR: so you can do things like go on a walk or going to the grocery store no problem , and just use it for more exertional stuff ?
[31] PATIENT: yes .
[32] PATIENT: like , if i'm gon na go for a run or something like that i'll really just take it before as a preventative .
[33] DOCTOR: okay .
[34] PATIENT: and i've been trying to use my daily if i can a little less because i'm trying to go into the military soon .
[35] DOCTOR: no kidding , that's great .
[36] PATIENT: yeah , so i have to be able to operate basically at a certain fitness level without an inhaler .
[37] DOCTOR: really ?
[38] PATIENT: yeah , and if i can prove that i'm capable of these activities without an inhaler it makes it easier .
[39] DOCTOR: and so by inhaler do they mean both your daily and rescue inhalers ?
[40] PATIENT: mm-hmm .
[41] PATIENT: so it's like they'll have a fitness test and basically they'll tell me not to take my inhaler that day before the test , and then they'll see how the asthma affects me .
[42] PATIENT: and they're looking to see if it's serious enough to hold me back from joining or whatever .
[43] PATIENT: so i have been taking it less and less .
[44] PATIENT: and really some days i feel like i do n't need it .
[45] DOCTOR: and that is the wixela that you're not taking .
[46] DOCTOR: so on average per week , how many days of the week do you use one puff in the morning and one puff at night ?
[47] PATIENT: probably about three or four .
[48] DOCTOR: okay , three to four days per week and the other days it's once a day ?
[49] PATIENT: yes , that's correct .
[50] DOCTOR: okay .
[51] PATIENT: and it's either in the morning or at night that i'm taking it .
[52] DOCTOR: okay , and do you think that's working okay ?
[53] PATIENT: i do .
[54] DOCTOR: great .
[55] DOCTOR: and any urgent care or er visits at all for breathing over the past year ?
[56] PATIENT: nope .
[57] DOCTOR: okay , so i'm going to assume no one has put you on prednisone for breathing issues then .
[58] PATIENT: nope .
[59] DOCTOR: okay .
[60] DOCTOR: and now , military wise , what's the time frame of when you'll be completing some of these exertional tests ?
[61] DOCTOR: like , what are your next steps ?
[62] PATIENT: so , hopefully i'm going to be enlisted early spring of 2022 .
[63] PATIENT: so that gives me about six to seven months to get to a point where i'm able to exert my body where i do n't really need the inhaler .
[64] PATIENT: or at least show them that i have it under control .
[65] DOCTOR: now when you were in the other room you completed a breathing test , correct ?
[66] PATIENT: correct .
[67] DOCTOR: okay , great .
[68] DOCTOR: so now let me ask you about the allergies , 'cause i know typically you'll use the zyrtec in the spring , summer and fall , correct ?
[69] PATIENT: yeah , i do n't really ... um , or i'm sorry , i use it more during the spring and fall .
[70] PATIENT: i do n't really have to use it too much in the summer .
[71] DOCTOR: do you use it more just as needed in the summer ?
[72] PATIENT: yeah , that's right .
[73] DOCTOR: okay .
[74] DOCTOR: and have you been taking the zyrtec every day recently since you're right in the mix of spring ?
[75] PATIENT: not every day , but i do take it on days i know i'm going to be outside a lot .
[76] PATIENT: um , i do tend to work outside about three days a week so i'll definitely take it on those days .
[77] DOCTOR: and does it seem to work pretty well still ?
[78] DOCTOR: are you happy with it ?
[79] PATIENT: yeah , it does , it works great .
[80] DOCTOR: wonderful , good to hear .
[81] DOCTOR: and then i'm assuming you're staying away from the peanuts .
[82] DOCTOR: uh , last year you had told me it worked with ... uh , you worked with enterprise rent-a-car and one of the cars had a lot of peanuts in it that you were cleaning out and that gave you hives , uh , when you had touched it , is that correct ?
[83] PATIENT: yep , that's correct .
[84] DOCTOR: okay .
[85] DOCTOR: and has there been anything like that since that experience ?
[86] PATIENT: no , i do n't think so .
[87] PATIENT: i definitely became more cautious after that , so i usually wear , uh , wear long sleeves and change my gloves every time now .
[88] PATIENT: so i have n't had a reaction , but i imagine that i probably came into contact with cars that had peanuts in them , but they just d- did n't touch my skin .
[89] DOCTOR: super .
[90] DOCTOR: and it sounds like you're really smart about it .
[91] PATIENT: yeah , and the airplanes , they have peanuts .
[92] PATIENT: they give everyone too , so .
[93] DOCTOR: okay .
[94] DOCTOR: and you have an epipen that k- that you keep with you , correct ?
[95] PATIENT: yes .
[96] DOCTOR: okay .
[97] DOCTOR: and i'm assuming you're going to need refills , um , i can call you in a new set for the year .
[98] DOCTOR: typically of course , they expire within a year .
[99] PATIENT: yeah , okay .
[100] DOCTOR: and i remember , um , sometime previously you've had some testing for tree nuts , but you do have almonds and cashews , correct ?
[101] DOCTOR: and- and you do okay with them , or do you avoid all tree nuts ?
[102] PATIENT: i do tend to avoid all of them but i recall eating some almonds at one point , uh , really soon after we discussed i might not be allergic to tree nuts anymore .
[103] DOCTOR: okay .
[104] PATIENT: and i remember having them and nothing happened , but i usually just tend to stay away from them , um , really if i can help it .
[105] DOCTOR: okay .
[106] DOCTOR: so sometimes when people have a peanut allergy , the nuts in general just are n't very important to them , so it is very common to avoid both .
[107] DOCTOR: um , so let's do this .
[108] DOCTOR: i'll have helen come in and i would love to complete a breathing test on you .
[109] DOCTOR: if your breathing numbers are looking great we can work on getting you , uh , something lower than wixela .
[110] DOCTOR: if you look at all of our asthma regimens it is a stepwise process , and wixela is a combination of two medications in one .
[111] DOCTOR: and , well maybe you do n't need both of'em .
[112] DOCTOR: uh , maybe you just need one of'em .
[113] DOCTOR: so we can work our way backwards .
[114] PATIENT: okay .
[115] DOCTOR: and so the breathing test will help give us some- some more guidance , we will look at the results in just a moment .
[116] PATIENT: all right , and so this past year i did get into the bad habit of vaping and smoking , but i have been trying to cut that out .
[117] PATIENT: so i should be good , and , um , now i only do just a little bit and i am trying to quit .
[118] PATIENT: so i am sure that might have an effect .
[119] DOCTOR: it can .
[120] DOCTOR: um , so what we can do today is compare your results with prior results , probably before you started smoking or using the vape .
[121] PATIENT: okay .
[122] DOCTOR: yeah .
[123] DOCTOR: and we'll see where you stand at that point .
[124] PATIENT: all right , that sounds good .
[125] DOCTOR: well let me go ahead and listen , so hop on up here for me .
[126] PATIENT: okay .
[127] DOCTOR: all right so your ears look good , a little bit of wax on both sides .
[128] DOCTOR: can i see inside your mouth ?
[129] DOCTOR: big ahh .
[130] PATIENT: ahh .
[131] DOCTOR: good .
[132] DOCTOR: okay let me take a peek in your nose .
[133] DOCTOR: all right , good .
[134] DOCTOR: you can put your mask back on .
[135] PATIENT: okay .
[136] DOCTOR: and go ahead take a big breath in and out .
[137] DOCTOR: good , your lungs sound terrific .
[138] DOCTOR: i'll listen to your heart , breathe quietly .
[139] DOCTOR: okay very good .
[140] PATIENT: awesome .
[141] DOCTOR: so your breathing test is about the same as it was a couple years ago , and actually looks a little bit better .
[142] DOCTOR: you may not remember but when we last completed the test in 2019 , uh , do you recall if you were feeling lousy at the time ?
[143] PATIENT: i think it was the smoke .
[144] PATIENT: there were so many fires at that point and i remember coming in and looking out the window and all you saw was the orange and the smoke .
[145] DOCTOR: yes , you're absolutely right , that was a bad year .
[146] DOCTOR: that was my first fall here and i was really alarmed .
[147] DOCTOR: well that explains why at that time your numbers were a little bit lower and today they look better .
[148] DOCTOR: here's what i think , so you'll have kaiser currently , correct ?
[149] PATIENT: correct .
[150] DOCTOR: okay .
[151] DOCTOR: most insurances do limit what we can use .
[152] PATIENT: yeah i do know that .
[153] DOCTOR: okay so option one would be to continue using wixela like you're using it now .
[154] DOCTOR: we would classify it as off-label and you can use it once a day instead of twice a day , which is fine .
[155] DOCTOR: some people do that because they just need it once a day , so that's an option .
[156] DOCTOR: option two would be to actually back up to an inhaler that just has one med .
[157] PATIENT: mm-hmm
[158] DOCTOR: so the one that kaiser covers is alvesco .
[159] DOCTOR: the thing about alvesco , though , is that it would be two puffs in the morning and two puffs at night .
[160] DOCTOR: so it's a bit more work .
[161] DOCTOR: um , it's not breath activated but we could step down the lowest dose to see how you do .
[162] DOCTOR: some of the newer guidelines for asthma that were published this year is recommending trying to treat people with inhalers like wixela or alvesco only when you're ill , or say during smoke season .
[163] DOCTOR: so minimizing their use to those periods of time versus all year .
[164] DOCTOR: unless you found out that you're getting
[165] DOCTOR: sick having issues every month , then that would indicate would pull back too much .
[166] PATIENT: okay .
[167] DOCTOR: that we had too much , yeah .
[168] PATIENT: okay .
[169] DOCTOR: um , so we could step back and possibly get you to the point where you just use those inhalers , uh , when you're ill or it's smoke season , but at the first step to do any of that would be to try to drop down to just alvesco .
[170] PATIENT: okay , that actually sounds really good .
[171] DOCTOR: okay great .
[172] DOCTOR: so i will call that in for you , it will be the lower dose , 80 mcg , and you'll have to do two puffs twice a day .
[173] PATIENT: all right
[174] DOCTOR: okay and that'll be on the box when i call it in .
[175] DOCTOR: you can put the wixela off to the side , but do n't throw it away just in case the alvesco does n't work well for you .
[176] PATIENT: okay , got it .
[177] DOCTOR: and then ideally we would repeat your breathing test in four months to see how you're doing , and then be able to document that you're doing well .
[178] DOCTOR: sometimes , not always , the military will require documentation on breathing tests .
[179] PATIENT: okay .
[180] DOCTOR: is your pharmacy still the same or did you update it with helen ?
[181] PATIENT: yeah i believe she updated it .
[182] PATIENT: it should be kaiser permanente broadway .
[183] DOCTOR: okay perfect .
[184] DOCTOR: i'll make sure it's the alvesco and then i'll renew your albuterol and epipen as well .
[185] PATIENT: awesome , thank you .
[186] DOCTOR: you're welcome .
[187] DOCTOR: uh , then the zyrtec , do you pick it up over the counter or do get- do you get it as a prescription ?
[188] PATIENT: i just get it over the counter .
[189] DOCTOR: okay got it .
[190] DOCTOR: and do you have a nebulizer that you would , uh , need refills on ?
[191] PATIENT: i do n't think i need any refills , i have n't used that in such a long time .
[192] PATIENT: i think the last time was when i had bronchitis , or there was few select times when i had to use it when i was kid .
[193] DOCTOR: okay good .
[194] DOCTOR: well i think we have our game plan .
[195] PATIENT: okay awesome .
[196] DOCTOR: and do the alvesco two puffs twice a day and your albuterol if you need it .
[197] DOCTOR: the zyrtec 10 milligrams as you need it and continue to stay away from peanuts and tree nuts and i'll refill your epipen .
[198] PATIENT: okay
[199] DOCTOR: all right so we've got it .
[200] PATIENT: great .
[201] DOCTOR: all right i'll have you take this to the front and i'm gon na say four months re-check for asthma and we'll repeat the spirometer- spirometry at that time .
[202] PATIENT: okay sounds good .
[203] DOCTOR: all right well thanks so much and you have a great day .
[204] PATIENT: you too .
[205] DOCTOR: and we'll do a follow-up in four months with act and spirometry , sooner if needed .
[206] DOCTOR: follow-up 25 minutes .assistant

[8] PATIENT: yeah i doctor wood is my primary care provider and i talked to him about it actually over the years and this last visit he said he referred me to you
[9] DOCTOR: okay okay good so ice and rest makes it feel better running and and activity makes it hurt a little bit more is that correct
[10] PATIENT: yeah that's right
[11] DOCTOR: okay do you have any family history of arthritis or any of those type of immune diseases
[12] PATIENT: i'm trying to think no i do n't think so no
[13] DOCTOR: okay and do you get is it is this primarily worse in the morning or does it is it just there all the time when it comes on
[14] PATIENT: it actually is worse towards the end of the day
[15] DOCTOR: okay
[16] PATIENT: once i'm on my feet all day it starts to ache towards the afternoon
[17] DOCTOR: okay so let's go ahead and i want to do a quick examination here your blood pressure and was one twenty over sixty that's phenomenal your heart rate was fifty eight and you can tell that you're a runner with that that level of a heart rate and your respirations were fourteen so all of that looked very good there was no fever when you came in when i'm gon na just quickly listen to your heart and lungs okay those those sound good but let me get let's focus here on your lower extremities i'm i'm gon na look at your your left knee first when i move your left knee do you get any type of pain or is it just feel like normal and it's always your pain's always isolated to the right
[18] PATIENT: that feels that feels normal
[19] DOCTOR: okay okay so let me i just want you to back up here in the stretcher a little bit more and i'm just gon na do some movement of your knee any okay so i want you to push your leg out against my hand does that hurt
[20] PATIENT: no
[21] DOCTOR: okay and if you pull back does that hurt a little bit
[22] PATIENT: no
[23] DOCTOR: okay and i'm gon na move it around so when i look at the knee there is no redness there's no swelling i can appreciate a a small amount of effusion and that means that there's a little bit of fluid under the knee or in that knee's joint space and there is there is several reasons that could be now when i push on your knee does it hurt more on the inside or does it hurt more on the outside here
[24] PATIENT: the the right knee here hurts on the outside

[142] DOCTOR: But um, that's not usually a life-threatening problem.
[143] PATIENT: OK.
[144] DOCTOR: But, um, part of the reason why I'd like you to come in, it's just that we can do a, a what we call a, a neurological examination just to make sure there's nothing else going on, and confirm that might be the diagnosis.
[145] DOCTOR: Have a look, have a look inside the ear, see if there's any, , anything to see within the ear.
[146] PATIENT: OK.

[18] PATIENT: yes i have
[19] DOCTOR: okay so you might have a little white coat syndrome i know some of my patients definitely do have that so what about your diet i know we talked a little bit before about you reducing your sodium intake to about twenty three hundred milligrams per per day i know you were during the pandemic your diet got out of little bit out of control so how have you been doing how have you been doing with that
[20] PATIENT: i definitely need some help there i have not have not made some some changes
[21] DOCTOR: okay yeah we definitely need to get you to lower that salt intake get your diet a little bit better because the hope is to get you off that medication and get your blood pressure to a manageable level okay so we yeah we definitely can talk about that alright so lem me take a look at your knee i'll do a quick physical exam on you and before i do just want to make sure you're not having any chest pain today
[22] PATIENT: no
[23] DOCTOR: are you any belly pain
[24] PATIENT: no
[25] DOCTOR: no shortness of breath just wan na make sure
[26] PATIENT: no
[27] DOCTOR: okay so i'm just gon na listen to your lungs here your lungs are clear bilaterally i do n't hear any wheezes or crackles listen to your heart so on your heart exam i do still hear that grade two out of six systolic ejection murmur and you already had that and so we we knew about that already so lem me look at your knee here so when i press here on the inside of your knee does that hurt

[131] DOCTOR: Do you drink much in the way of, , do you, do you smoke, or do you drink much in the way of alcohol?
[132] PATIENT: Uh, I don't, I don't smoke, uh, I do drink, like on the weekends, yeah.
[133] DOCTOR: , so socially, OK. All right.
[134] DOCTOR: Um, right, excellent.
[135] DOCTOR: So, um, at this stage I , I would proceed to examination.
[136] PATIENT: Yeah.
[137] DOCTOR: But um, based on your story, um, just to summarise really.
[138] DOCTOR: So, last three days, you've been having bit of burning pain on passing urine.
[139] DOCTOR: A bit of, crampy tummy pain lower down.
[140] DOCTOR: Um, , essentially but, but no other fevers or back pain, uh, if I, if I understand correctly.
[141] DOCTOR: I think probably do have what we call a simple UTI or urinary tract infection, bladder infection, um, which can be readily treated.
[142] DOCTOR: So, I'll give you a course of antibiotics today.
[143] PATIENT: Mm-hmm.
[144] PATIENT: OK.
[145] DOCTOR: Something, called either Nitrofurantoin, or Trimethoprim.
[146] DOCTOR: Uh, and it's normally a three day course.
[147] DOCTOR: Uh, so, one tablet, twice a day, for three days.
[148] PATIENT: OK.
[149] DOCTOR: And , that should hopefully help your symptoms, but I also advise you to drink plenty of fluids.
[150] DOCTOR: Let's try and flush that, you know, that infection out of your body, if you can.
[151] PATIENT: OK.
[152] DOCTOR: Um, you can try, cranberry juice, that can sometimes help with your symptoms.
[153] DOCTOR: Um, and if you're still not better, by the end of this week, I want you to give me a call or come back and see me.
[154] DOCTOR: And uh, we can have another look at your symptoms.
[155] PATIENT: OK, so three days of the medication, and then wait a little bit, if it still doesn't go away, call back, that OK?
[156] DOCTOR: OK.
[157] DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah absolutely.
[158] DOCTOR: And things to look out for would be, you know, if you are having kind of, high temperatures, a back pain, um just , generally feeling more unwell.
[159] DOCTOR: Uh, you know, I do want you give me a call back, 'cause then we do worry whether your infection may be spreading up towards your kidneys, which is something we wanna avoid.
[160] DOCTOR: So, do, do give me a call if you're having any concerns, OK.
[161] PATIENT: OK.
[162] PATIENT: OK, is there, is there anything like, like, should I be worried about?
[163] PATIENT: Like, like, not having sex or anything within the next week, or anything like this?
[164] DOCTOR: Yeah I mean if you can try and avoid it, I think that'd be sensible.
[165] DOCTOR: Um, uh, it's great that you're using barrier contraception.
[166] DOCTOR: I would recommend you to continue using barrier contraception, but if you can avoid it while your symptoms clear up.
[167] DOCTOR: That'd probably be the best for you and your boyfriend,.
[168] PATIENT: OK, OK.
[169] PATIENT: Uh, that, that makes sense.
[170] PATIENT: Ohh, OK, thank you so much.
[171] DOCTOR: All right.
[172] DOCTOR: Great.
[173] DOCTOR: Thank you very much.
[174] DOCTOR: Wish you all the best.

[67] PATIENT: Um
[68] DOCTOR: .
[69] DOCTOR: Well why don't we start with, is it, is it in the middle, or is it to one particular side?

[82] DOCTOR: Is it, is this pain as in making you double over?
[83] DOCTOR: Is it ten, is it ten out of ten, the worst pain you ever had?
[84] DOCTOR: Or is it more of a kind of a mild pain, like a three out of ten?
[85] PATIENT: I I guess so.
[86] PATIENT: I'm, when I think about it, like when I get it, I can pretend that I don't feel it.
[87] PATIENT: So I can still sit down and
[88] PATIENT: Uh I can still like cover it up, and people don't really notice.
[89] PATIENT: So I, I don't know what that means.

[235] DOCTOR: Well thank you for me.
[236] DOCTOR: That's really helpful to know.
[237] DOCTOR: So um, Dan, just as a a conclusion, uh um, just to wrap it all up, I think your symptoms are suggestive of something called gastroenteritis.
[238] PATIENT: OK.
[239] DOCTOR: bit of a basic infection of your tummy.
[240] DOCTOR: .
[241] DOCTOR: There's nothing to worry about.
[242] DOCTOR: Uh um uh uh I suspect this will just settle down in the next few days.
[243] PATIENT: OK.
[244] DOCTOR: Just like you did for you brother.
[245] DOCTOR: Drink, make sure you drink plenty of fluids, OK?
[246] DOCTOR: And you can
[247] PATIENT: Uh-huh.
[248] PATIENT: Should I just drink like normal water?
[249] PATIENT: I just feel like every time I drink it's just coming out.
[250] PATIENT: Um
[251] DOCTOR: Right.
[252] DOCTOR: fluid is probably best.
[253] DOCTOR: But I am obviously worried about the fact that you are losing minerals and vitamins.
[254] DOCTOR: Um so, you can get things like Diarolyte, which is um, a fluid replacement you can get from the pharmacy.
[255] DOCTOR: It's probably worth uh recommending that.
[256] PATIENT: Do i need like a prescription for that?
[257] DOCTOR: no, you can just get that over the counter.
[258] PATIENT: OK.
[259] DOCTOR: Um, you can try just you know regular Paracetamol if you are feeling feverish.
[260] DOCTOR: But if your symptoms aren't settling down in the next couple of days, so forty eight hours, I want you to give me a call back.
[261] DOCTOR: Because um, you know if you are getting dehydrated then we need to do further investigations, OK?
[262] DOCTOR: But I think let's, let's see how you are in the next one to two days.
[263] PATIENT: OK.
[264] DOCTOR: And uh, we'll catch up soon, OK?
[265] PATIENT: OK.
[266] PATIENT: So you're saying that I should, I could, uh I'll try and buy this Dioralyte.
[267] PATIENT: What, what should I do in terms of um, food and that kind of thing?
[268] PATIENT: Should I just focus on fluids?
[269] DOCTOR: clear fluids.
[270] DOCTOR: You can use soft diet, things like soup, mash.
[271] DOCTOR: And then gradually build up, um as much as your body can tolerate.
[272] DOCTOR: Um, but let's try and keep yourself well-hydrated first, OK?
[273] PATIENT: OK. Is it OK for me to carry on having like, um Paracetamol and things like that?
[274] DOCTOR: Absolutely.
[275] DOCTOR: If you are having, if you've got a bit of tummy pain, if you're feeling feverish, then I think Paracetamol is very sensible.
[276] PATIENT: OK.
[277] DOCTOR: OK?
[278] DOCTOR: Try and avoid alcohol if you can.
[279] PATIENT: Uh, OK I'll try.
[280] PATIENT: Yeah.
[281] DOCTOR: OK. Alright then.
[282] PATIENT: OK.
[283] DOCTOR: Thank you for your help.
[284] PATIENT: Alright.
[285] PATIENT: Thank you very much.
[286] PATIENT: Thanks, thanks for helping me out.

[9] DOCTOR: My name's .
[10] PATIENT: My address is, uh, sixty four, Cliveden Place, in, South Wimbledon.
[11] DOCTOR: OK. Are you in a private place where you can have a confidential consultation today?
[12] PATIENT: Yes I am, yeah.
[13] DOCTOR: What can I do for you?
[14] PATIENT: Um, I've been feeling really anxious over the past few months.
[15] PATIENT: Um, I just get really nervous every morning about leaving the house, and it's started to really worry me, and just add up, and build up on that anxiety.
[16] PATIENT: And I just didn't know, who to talk to or, so I wanted to check with my GP.
[17] DOCTOR: OK. Do you mind just telling me a bit more about, when it started?
[18] DOCTOR: Do you think there's something which changed in your life at that time?
[19] PATIENT: Um, I guess so, I think um, I would say maybe about two months or so, I've been feeling like this, and that probably coincides with, me starting a new job, um.
[20] PATIENT: Which I , I would say it's quite , I mean every job is stressful, and when you first start, but it's been really stressful I think over the past two months, definitely.
[21] DOCTOR: What's your job?
[22] PATIENT: Um, so I work for a, a, a fashion retailer, in um, the head office team, and it's just a brand new sector.
[23] PATIENT: I've never worked in retail before, my boss is not very nice to me and I don't.
[24] PATIENT: But I also think that, it's just been, I just really dread, going there.
[25] PATIENT: I just hate, speaking to her, I hate like seeing everyone and, really worried about whether I'm doing well or not.
[26] PATIENT: And it's really impacting on like, on the rest of my life, like my sleep and stuff like that.
[27] DOCTOR: OK.
[28] DOCTOR: So, um, just day-to-day, tell me, from the start of your day, how it affects you.
[29] DOCTOR: You said that you, you dread going to work.
[30] DOCTOR: How, how does it affect you, in terms of like your sleep at night, and things like that?
[31] PATIENT: Right.
[32] PATIENT: Yeah, this is really so, I, I, I've, as I say like, I don't want to go to work in the morning, so I just find no way of, I can't get out of bed.
[33] PATIENT: But it's also because, when I leave I just, when I've left work, I just feel so stressed and so worried about everything I've done, I can't get to sleep for hours and hours and hours.
[34] PATIENT: So I.
[35] DOCTOR: OK.
[36] DOCTOR: So what time, what time do you go to bed at night-time?
[37] PATIENT: About ten, eleven, probably.
[38] DOCTOR: And what time do you get to sleep?
[39] PATIENT: Not for ages, I'm, I'm lying awake all night
[40] DOCTOR: OK. And, when you eventually get to sleep, do you wake up with your alarm in the morning, or does something else wake you up, before then?
[41] PATIENT: Mmm.
[42] PATIENT: So I find my, my heart kind of racing, and then I'm just like panicking that I'm gonna be late, and that that's gonna make work even more stressful.
[43] PATIENT: So I do have an alarm, but I find myself waking up before that, 'cause I'm just my heart is racing.
[44] PATIENT: And actually the other day, I was just like, I was lying in bed and I really thought my heart was racing so much, I thought I was gonna have a heart attack in the morning.
[45] DOCTOR: OK. And, so how many hours sleep do you think you get a night?
[46] PATIENT: , I just, I can't even tell because I feel like I'm, even when I'm in sleep it's such a shallow sleep, but maybe, three, four hours, I'm getting now.
[47] DOCTOR: OK. And, what about your eating patterns, any change in how you're eating, or whether you, your appetite's changed?
[48] PATIENT: Probably, not, significant changes maybe.
[49] PATIENT: No I wouldn't say that, I wouldn't say that I'm eating like, much differently.
[50] PATIENT: Ohh that, I probably have more chocolate than normal, just because I feel, so down.
[51] DOCTOR: OK. You're eating regularly otherwise?
[52] PATIENT: Yeah, .
[53] DOCTOR: OK. And, you told me about the palpitations, just tell me a bit more about that.
[54] PATIENT: Yeah, So um, it's, it's usually kind of like, when I realise in the morning that, either um, I feel like I'm gonna be late, because I've like overslept 'cause I'm so tired.
[55] PATIENT: Um, or I wake up in a panic thinking I am gonna be late so, it's just kind of like, just a constant like, rapid heart beating.
[56] PATIENT: It's just really, really stressful.
[57] PATIENT: I don't know if it's, stress or if, , or I did think it was like, a heart problem really actually.
[58] DOCTOR: Does it feel like a regular fast beat, or an irregular, beat?
[59] PATIENT: Irregular, I think.
[60] DOCTOR: And how long do you think it lasts for when you get it?
[61] PATIENT: Ohh it can be anything, I think couple of minutes, or the other day I was actually just, sort of lying there for like, holding my hand on my chest for like ten minutes.
[62] DOCTOR: OK. Is that something that you've had before this, or is that a new thing?
[63] PATIENT: Yeah, but I would say this is only in the past.
[64] PATIENT: Sort of like, couple of months as I say that I've been, experiencing this.
[65] DOCTOR: OK. Any chest pain with that?
[66] PATIENT: No, um, well yeah it's painful to , when the heart, when my heart is beating fast but, but, yeah.
[67] DOCTOR: OK.
[68] DOCTOR: And, in the daytime, how, how, you said you, you're not getting much sleep so, how's your energy level in the daytime?
[69] PATIENT: It's just, really, really low, I mean I, I'm finding now that I'm just, I find no enjoyment at all.
[70] PATIENT: It's kind of day-to-day, and anything that I'm doing.
[71] PATIENT: It's not just my job it's, you know when I leave I'm just so tired that, anything that, previously was, really fun is just not, it's not enjoyable.
[72] PATIENT: And I'm like, yeah, on edge the whole time.
[73] DOCTOR: OK.
[74] DOCTOR: So what do you do in the evenings?
[75] PATIENT: Well right now I'm, I'm working so late, and everything is really, really stressful.
[76] PATIENT: So I don't really get much time to myself but, when I do wanna go out, or, you know, see friends or just relax.
[77] PATIENT: It, it seems quite difficult to do that.
[78] DOCTOR: OK, and , are you avoiding contact with friends, or do you still see them?
[79] PATIENT: I avoid them insomuch that I, feel like I'm.
[80] PATIENT: Yeah, so I mean sometimes it just, I know that I'm not gonna have fun, because I don't want to, go out and, do things that I would normally have done.
[81] DOCTOR: OK. What about, hobbies, or exercise, or anything else outside work?
[82] DOCTOR: Do you do anything else outside work?
[83] PATIENT: Yeah, as I say like everything that I had previously been doing has been, just difficult to continue with like, I did used to like to like go running, and.
[84] PATIENT: And to play tennis and stuff, but now it's just not, I'm just not enjoying it, I'm not, I'm not like, I'm not going out to do that quite so much.
[85] DOCTOR: And have you, has it ever got so bad that you've actually had to miss work?
[86] PATIENT: No, 'cause I think that would just add to the tension, but I do like pretty much every morning I think, ohh I should call in sick or like, just not go.
[87] DOCTOR: OK.
[88] DOCTOR: And, what's the worst that it's got?
[89] DOCTOR: Have you ever, been, um, so overwhelmed that you couldn't, get in to the office, you couldn't, go into a situation?
[90] DOCTOR: Have you ever had a panic attack?
[91] PATIENT: , um.
[92] PATIENT: No I wouldn't say so, I think, I've always managed to make it to work.
[93] PATIENT: But I, I wonder if it's building up.
[94] PATIENT: So this is why I wanted to call, I'm just worried it's building up to that, and I don't know what to do 'cause I have, feel it, felt it, get worse and worse over the past couple of months.
[95] DOCTOR: OK. And apart from work, are there any other situations which evoke quite extreme anxiety, like being, in public places, social situations, public transport, anything like that?
[96] PATIENT: Yeah I mean, I find public transport really stressful anyway, especially being on the tube it's, 'cause it's quite, getting warmer so it's just really airless.
[97] PATIENT: Um, but I think the majority of it, 'cause my life is just so focused around work right now, the majority of it is focused around work as well.
[98] DOCTOR: OK. Before this did you have any similar times in your life when you felt like this?
[99] PATIENT: Not really I, I'm, no, I would say.
[100] PATIENT: I mean everybody always has a bit of tension, a bit of anxiety but, I've never felt, anything this bad before.
[101] DOCTOR: OK. And what about your mood day-to-day?
[102] DOCTOR: I mean, I can see that you're quite distressed by like that.
[103] DOCTOR: Do you ever get really down about this?
[104] PATIENT: Yeah.
[105] PATIENT: Um, I mean, yeah, yeah, 'cause I do, yeah.
[106] PATIENT: I'm pretty much, down like, I don't enjoy, being and not just my day at all 'cause.
[107] PATIENT: I'm just so worried about everything, um, and I find that even when I'm not, like even at the weekends and stuff it's just the, kind of like constant, feeling of just being a bit, down, a bit unhappy.
[108] DOCTOR: When do you think you last felt yourself?
[109] PATIENT: Um.
[110] PATIENT: I don't know, that's a good question, I can't really, I can't really put a on that at all.
[111] DOCTOR: .
[112] DOCTOR: And has your mood ever been so low that you've felt like you just couldn't carry on with your job, or with your life, or with your normal, uh, things as they we're going on?
[113] PATIENT: I wouldn't, no I wouldn't say that I've had, I haven't had any suicidal thoughts or any, thoughts that have been that extreme like, I haven't.
[114] PATIENT: You know I have, I have a good support system, like I do have good family and stuff.
[115] PATIENT: So I, I have, I don't have, uh worries about, actually wanting to, um, not go on.
[116] PATIENT: It's just that, I don't wanna go on like this.
[117] DOCTOR: Yeah.
[118] DOCTOR: OK. And where do you, who do you live with at home?
[119] PATIENT: Sorry?
[120] DOCTOR: Who do you live with at home?
[121] PATIENT: Yeah, I live with my parents, just my parents.
[122] DOCTOR: Um, and, how much alcohol do you have in an average week do you think?
[123] PATIENT: Um, ooh I don't know, probably quite a lot on the Friday or Saturday, just because, that, that's kind of normal, um.
[124] PATIENT: Uh, maybe I, maybe I do have like a bit during the week.
[125] PATIENT: Like, my parents obviously are retired, so they just drink whenever they want, so, whenever they're having a glass of wine, they'll offer it to me and it's like.
[126] PATIENT: I guess I don't really keep track of it that much.
[127] DOCTOR: OK.
[128] DOCTOR: So, how much would you, would you guess?
[129] PATIENT: Probably like, probably quite a lot on a Friday or Saturday, because it's usually going out, so maybe like.
[130] PATIENT: I probably go over my limit just on those days, anyway, and then like, maybe a glass of wine during the week .
[131] DOCTOR: OK. Do you smoke or take any other drugs, or anything?
[132] PATIENT: Um, I try not to smoke, but I do, occasionally, but I don't take drugs.
[133] DOCTOR: OK. And have you done , anything yourself to help?
[134] DOCTOR: Have you , have you talked to anyone, talked to any counsellors?
[135] DOCTOR: Done any, online, looked online at all?
[136] DOCTOR: Any ways to ?
[137] PATIENT: I, well I talk to my mum, because she also suffers from, well she's , suffered from like depression in the past.
[138] PATIENT: I didn't think that it was, that I was suffering from, actual depression because it just seems to be, manifesting as, as total , as just stress the whole time.
[139] DOCTOR: OK.
[140] PATIENT: But um, I did talk to my mum about it but I haven't sought any, she recommended that I come to the GP, um, but I haven't sought any other.
[141] DOCTOR: OK.
[142] DOCTOR: And would you be happy to, have, some one-to-one therapy?
[143] PATIENT: Yeah I think, yeah I think so.
[144] PATIENT: I've never done that before, but yeah.
[145] DOCTOR: OK.
[146] DOCTOR: I mean what we would suggest in the first instance is to, to.
[147] DOCTOR: So you can self-refer via the NHS, for what we call like, talking therapy which is a type of inter-behavioural, where they can really look at your situation.
[148] DOCTOR: How you're reacting to, the, , why, what's provoking anxiety, and what you can do, to try and overcome that.
[149] PATIENT: OK.
[150] PATIENT: Yeah.
[151] DOCTOR: Um, so I can send you the link for that.
[152] DOCTOR: Um, in the meantimes it can be a bit of a wait.
[153] DOCTOR: There are some online resources that are really helpful.
[154] DOCTOR: Um, can put the details, on there and you can, get on with them straight away and try and work through them as well.
[155] PATIENT: Uh-huh.
[156] DOCTOR: Um, and if you're feeling like it's not helping at all, or your anxiety is getting worse, to the point where you can't cope with work, or you can't, just do your normal things day-to-day.
[157] DOCTOR: Then, it's important for us to, for you to give us a call, back and just discuss that, further.
[158] PATIENT: OK. .
[159] DOCTOR: I mean some people, with anxiety they, do need to take medication to control that but that's, not something that we'd suggest in the first instance.
[160] PATIENT: OK.
[161] DOCTOR: And I'll put some more information on your notes about, helping with your, sleep patterns and things like that.
[162] PATIENT: That's great, I look forward to reading it.
[163] DOCTOR: Um, in terms of palpitations, it is most likely to be a, , associated with anxiety, but it's probably worth having couple of basic blood tests just to make sure that, there's not something triggering that off.
[164] DOCTOR: And then arranging a GP follow-up a week after you've had the tests, so we can just go through the results with you.
[165] PATIENT: OK, OK. Yeah, .
[166] DOCTOR: So if you call the support line you can arrange the, to have the blood test done.
[167] PATIENT: OK, I'll call them up.
[168] DOCTOR: OK?
[169] PATIENT: Thank you so much.
[170] DOCTOR: All right.
[171] DOCTOR: Take care.
[172] PATIENT: Have a good day.
[173] PATIENT: Bye.

[1] DOCTOR: hey hi bobby how are you doing
[2] PATIENT: i'm doing good how are you
[3] DOCTOR: i'm doing fine so i understand you're here having some left or some right shoulder pain that you've had for a few weeks now
[4] PATIENT: yeah it was i was doing some work in my backyard and a lot of different projects going on and you know i was obviously sore all over the next couple of days but my my right shoulder just keeps on bothering me and it keeps it's just really sore and it just has n't been going away
[5] DOCTOR: okay so have you had ever had any pain in that shoulder before
[6] PATIENT: a little bit i you know i i hurt that same shoulder because it's my my dominant hand my right hand i hurt it playing baseball when i was younger
[7] DOCTOR: mm-hmm
[8] PATIENT: so i've always had a little bit issues but this is it's does n't feel like it's in the rotator cuff it's it's kinda more on the outside and it's kinda like it's more tender on the outside when i raise my arm up so
[9] DOCTOR: okay yeah are you able to move your arm very well or not
[10] PATIENT: yeah there is no restriction with my arm it just i definitely feel some pain on the outside of it
[11] DOCTOR: okay and are you having pain all the time or just or does it come and go
[12] PATIENT: just whenever i move it if i'm sitting still i really do n't notice anything but whenever i move it then i can definitely feel some pain
[13] DOCTOR: okay how about at night is it bothering you at night also
[14] PATIENT: a little bit because i sleep on that side so
[15] DOCTOR: okay
[16] PATIENT: of course
[17] DOCTOR: okay and i may miss did you say what have you been taking for pain for that
[18] PATIENT: i just been taking some advil and then icing as much as i can so that's about it
[19] DOCTOR: okay and does that seem to help or
[20] PATIENT: a little bit yeah a little bit i mean it's it's still like you know sore to touch but it definitely dulls it a little bit
[21] DOCTOR: well sounds like you have quite a few projects going on what all what all are you doing for for your yard and
[22] PATIENT: i well let's see i've been putting an outdoor shower in we're extending our patio putting making some flower boxes putting down some you know for stone and all the flower beds so my wife's really put me to work i got a laundry lift
[23] DOCTOR: wow it sounds like a variety of projects but if you're putting down stone you're probably lifting those as well and then
[24] PATIENT: yeah
[25] DOCTOR: yeah i bet that is sore now tell me this have you experienced any numbness in your arm or your hands or
[26] PATIENT: no not really no numbness that i can think of
[27] DOCTOR: okay alright so see i'm gon na i'd like to do just a quick physical exam and i've reviewed your vitals those look good your no fever so that's good you're ninety seven .
[28] DOCTOR: eight and your heart rate looks good at sixty two respirations sixteen your blood pressures one sixteen over eighty four that looks fine your oxygen saturation is real good at ninety nine percent so that all looks good so let's take a look at your left at your right shoulder so you have limited active and passive range of motion and there is some tenderness at the great tuberosity of the humerus there is no tenderness at the sternoclavicular or acro acromioclavicular joints you do have a good hand grip okay and on neurovascular exam of your right arm your capillary refill is less than three seconds and your sensation to touch is intact so i've reviewed the results of your shoulder x-ray and there is no fracture so that's good so let me tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan so for your first problem the left shoulder pain your symptoms are most likely due to this rotator cuff rotator cuff tendinopathy that means you that you injured injured the tendons of the muscles that help make your shoulder muscles i think we had to go ahead and order just an mri since you have had some problems before as well to make sure there's nothing else going on with it and i also want to refer you to physical therapy for approximately six to eight weeks and so during that time continue the tylenol and if your symptoms do n't improve we can go ahead and consider a steroid injection of your shoulder which could provide some relief do you have any questions about your plan
[29] PATIENT: no that sounds good
[30] DOCTOR: okay alright yeah a lot of patients it's very successful with the physical therapy so i really hope that will do it and so we'll just start there okay
[31] PATIENT: sounds great
[32] DOCTOR: okay thanks
[33] PATIENT: thanks
[34] DOCTOR: did you have any other any other problems any other injuries that that went along with this or
[35] PATIENT: my both my my feet are actually really sore too i obviously have been doing a lot of other yard work so you know it's kinda it's really stiff and stuff and they you know my ankle joints as well my wife seems to think that i do n't drink enough water so it could be something along that lines but i do n't know they're kinda this they just they're really sore and stuff so i've been trying to put them up and kinda put ice on them keep them elevated and it seems to be helping out a little bit but
[36] DOCTOR: yeah so if you do n't feel that you did anything to injure it we might start just maybe do some epsom salts have you tried soaking your feet in epsom salts that will tend to kinda pull out what's going on in there and just help your those muscles to relax and the soreness to to go away you might try that
[37] PATIENT: okay that sounds like a plan that sounds goodassistant

[29] DOCTOR: yeah
[30] PATIENT: but that's it was i i could n't believe tiger went out there of course he did
[31] DOCTOR: right
[32] PATIENT: it was cool to see nothing
[33] DOCTOR: yep yep agreed agreed and so well listen we'll we'll hopefully get you feeling better here and get you back out on the court and out on the course and we'll talk about that but let's let me ask you about your diabetes a little bit a little bit here so how have your blood sugars been running mark have they been what in the low one hundreds two hundreds where are they
[34] PATIENT: they are like one fifty one sixty you know we just had easter and my kids got a whole bunch of candies so i keep eating that
[35] DOCTOR: hmmm okay yeah yeah understood so those cadboy eggs they'll get you every time too right
[36] PATIENT: yes
[37] DOCTOR: boy my gosh yeah those are the best so those are those are deadly do n't tell my cardiologist so okay so listen you know i see that we have you on metformin five hundred milligrams once a day no actually last visit we increased it so i've got you on metformin five hundred milligrams twice a day correct you're still taking that
[38] PATIENT: yes twice a day
[39] DOCTOR: okay and but your blood sugars are a bit off you know maybe those the cadberry eggs so how about your asthma how has that been doing you know have you had any asthma attacks you're still taking flovent twice a day and the albuterol as needed
[40] PATIENT: yeah knock on wood i my asthma is pretty much under control
[41] DOCTOR: okay excellent excellent alright and i recall you know just kinda review a few things i i think you've got an allergy to penicillin is that correct
[42] PATIENT: that's correct yes
[43] DOCTOR: okay and then you you know your surgical history you had your your gallbladder out what about ten years ago i think by doctor nelson correct
[44] PATIENT: yes that's right
[45] DOCTOR: okay and then let's go ahead and examine you alright so mark your exam is pretty much you know for the most part normal with a few exceptions on your heart exam you still have a grade three out of six systolic ejection murmur and that's unchanged from prior exam we're watching that and so that just means i hear some some heart sounds as your heart is beating there i'm not too concerned about it as as that's not changed otherwise normal cardiovascular exam and your physical exam otherwise on your musculoskeletal exam on your right elbow you do have moderate lateral epicondylar tenderness of the right elbow and how about when i move this when i move your elbow like this does that hurt you
[46] PATIENT: kills
[47] DOCTOR: okay sorry about that so you've got moderate pain with passive range of motion of the right elbow there is no palpable joint effusion and now what if i press against your wrist like so does that hurt you
[48] PATIENT: yeah it hurts a little bit
[49] DOCTOR: okay alright sorry so that's you have mild pain with resisted extension of the right wrist as well okay otherwise normal unremarkable exam and let's talk about your results now so your right elbow x-ray today shows no acute fracture or other bony abnormality so that's good there's no malalignment or sign of joint effusion and otherwise it's a normal right elbow x-ray so that's reassuring okay and hey you know i meant to ask you you know and do you have any history of fever recently you know along with the elbow pain you had noticed a fever
[50] PATIENT: no i do n't think so
[51] DOCTOR: okay great excellent alright so tell you what let's let's talk about my assessment and your plan here so for your first problem my assessment is is that you have acute lateral epicondylitis of your right elbow and this is also known as tennis elbow go figure right so this is due to overuse likely the increase in your your tennis activity which normally would be good but maybe we're overdoing it a little bit so i have a few recommendations i'd like you to rest your right arm as much as you can i want you to stop tennis for the next four to six weeks and please avoid repetitive stress in that right arm as well i want you to ice that right elbow for twenty minutes at least three times per day and this should reduce the pain and inflammation and then i'm also going to give you a brace for your right forearm and my nurse will give this to you before you leave that should help with the discomfort okay in that right elbow i will also write you a prescription for ultram and this should help with the pain i'll write you a prescription ultram fifty milligrams once per day that should help with your elbow pain so then i wan na see you in follow-up in four weeks and so we'll reevaluate your elbow at that time and if you we'll consider some additional imaging if needed possibly a physical therapy referral depending on how you're doing mkay now for your second problem of diabetes type two my assessment is is that your blood sugar is a little bit out of control mkay so we need to make some adjustments i'm going to increase your metformin to one thousand milligrams twice per day and i want you to check your blood sugar twice daily for the next two weeks and then let me know how your blood sugar is running and we can make some additional adjustments if needed but i will increase your metformin to one thousand milligrams twice a day now i'm going to also order a hemoglobin a1c level and and a cbc blood test today and and so we'll check those results the hemoglobin a1c and the cbc and then i'm going to also check a chem-12 blood test as well and now for your third problem of the mild acute intermittent asthma you my assessment is that it really remains under good control so let's keep you on that flovent and the albuterol no changes there and you can use those as tolerated it does look like you need a refill on your albuterol so i'm gon na write you a prescription for a refill of the albuterol and you can pick that up at your pharmacy as well so how does that all sound any questions for me
[52] PATIENT: it sounds pretty good i ca n't believe it's just tennis elbow feel like a looser coming in here but it's okay i get it
[53] DOCTOR: yeah yeah well
[54] PATIENT: i'm not i'm not young anymore
[55] DOCTOR: yeah well let's let's keep you active but take a break for a bit and let's ease back into it okay so it's great to see you and i'll see you back in four weeks let me know if you have other problems in the meantime

[68] DOCTOR: okay there is full range of motion of the right knee and on skin examination there is evidence of a bull's-eye rash over the right knee okay so what does that mean richard so that means that you know you do have some area of some inflammation over the over the right knee where you where you have that tick bite and you do have what we call that bull's eye rash which is what we get concerned about with with lyme disease so let's just talk a little bit about you know my assessment and my plan for you okay so for this first problem of your of your tick bite my concern is that you might have lyme disease based on the presentation of your right knee so i'm gon na go ahead and start you on doxycycline one hundred milligrams twice a day
[69] PATIENT: we're gon na continue that for about three weeks i'm also gon na go ahead and send a lyme titer as well as a western blot to see if you do in fact have lyme lyme disease and we'll have to go ahead and just see how you do with this we you know i'd like to avoid intravenous antibiotics which i think we can avoid but i wanted to see how you do so
[70] DOCTOR: do you have any questions about that
[71] PATIENT: yeah i did n't know what those last two things or just
[72] DOCTOR: yeah so so we are gon na start you on some antibiotics to help help you with this
[73] PATIENT: you know possible lyme disease and i'm gon na just order some blood tests just to see exactly what's going on and then you know sometimes people need intravenous antibiotics because lyme disease can cause problems on other organs like your heart that type of thing
[74] DOCTOR: if not treated appropriately and sometimes we need to give antibiotics through the iv which i'd like to avoid i think that we got this early enough that we can just treat you with some oral antibiotics okay for your second problem of your hypertension you know i think you're doing a really good job let's go ahead and continue you on the lisinopril twenty milligrams once a day and i wan na just go ahead and order a lipid panel just to make sure that everything is okay with your cholesterol how does that sound
[75] PATIENT: that's fine
[76] DOCTOR: great and then for your third problem of your diabetes i wan na just go ahead and order a hemoglobin a1c and continue you on the metformin one thousand milligrams twice a day it sounds like you're doing a good job since your blood sugars are running in the one twenties i do n't think we need to make any adjustments but we'll see what the hemoglobin a1c shows that gives us a an idea of what your blood sugars are doing on a long-term basis how does that sound
[77] PATIENT: okay at what point time do you start kinda checking kidney function i've been told that metformin can possibly cause some kidney issues
[78] DOCTOR: so it can you know your kidney function we've you know i think you've been really lucky it's been normal i checked it about two months ago and it looks pretty good it looks pretty normal but since we're doing blood work on you i can go ahead and order a a basic metabolic panel just to make sure that your kidney function is stable
[79] PATIENT: okay that'd be good
[80] DOCTOR: okay anything else
[81] PATIENT: not that i can think of at this time as soon as i leave
[82] DOCTOR: well you know where to find me okay
[83] PATIENT: alright
[84] DOCTOR: take care byeassistant

[1] DOCTOR: okay , so our next patient is christopher watson .
[2] DOCTOR: date of birth 04/12/1934 .
[3] DOCTOR: mr .
[4] DOCTOR: watson is- is an 86-year-old male who returns in follow-up for adult hydrocephalus .
[5] DOCTOR: this is his first visit since undergoing sh- shunt surgery , excuse me , on august 1st , 2020 .
[6] DOCTOR: i have followed mr .
[7] DOCTOR: watson since may of 2020 when he first presented with eight to ten years of progressive gait impairment , cognitive impairment , and decreased bladder control .
[8] DOCTOR: we established a diagnosis of adult hydrocephalus with a spino catheter protocol in june 2020 , and he underwent shunt surgery on august 1st , 2020 .
[9] DOCTOR: a medtronic strata programmable shunt in the ventricular peritoneal configuration was programmed at a level 2.0 was placed .
[10] DOCTOR: good morning , mr .
[11] DOCTOR: watson , who is the nice lady you have with you today ?
[12] PATIENT: hi , doc .
[13] PATIENT: this is my daughter , theresa .
[14] PATIENT: she is the one who helps me keep things straight .
[15] DOCTOR: mr .
[16] DOCTOR: watson , have you been sick or been hosp -- hospitalized since your shu- shunt surgery three months ago .
[17] PATIENT: uh , not that i recall .
[18] PATIENT: no , he has n't .
[19] PATIENT: he has been doing much better .
[20] DOCTOR: good , i'm glad to hear that .
[21] DOCTOR: before surgery , you were having some progressive problems that affected your walking , thinking , and bladder control .
[22] DOCTOR: are these symptoms better , worse , or unchanged ?
[23] PATIENT: his walking has improved .
[24] PATIENT: he's now able to walk to the dining room just fine .
[25] PATIENT: but he could not do that before surgery .
[26] PATIENT: he still has times where i have to help him .
[27] DOCTOR: that's impressive , mr .
[28] DOCTOR: watson .
[29] PATIENT: yeah , i guess .
[30] PATIENT: now his bladder control did improve some after surgery , but now seems to have leveled out .
[31] PATIENT: so he is wearing diapers .
[32] DOCTOR: no issues with sores from wearing the diaper ?
[33] DOCTOR: and any decreased or painful urination ?
[34] PATIENT: no , not at all .
[35] DOCTOR: and how about cognition ?
[36] PATIENT: i think i'm better .
[37] PATIENT: i do n't feel lost when talking to someone anymore .
[38] PATIENT: dad and i both think my sister , hannah , summarized it best .
[39] PATIENT: she said " i feel like i can have a normal conversation with him again , "
[40] DOCTOR: that's so wonderful !
[41] DOCTOR: now have you had any headaches or pain where the shunt is ?
[42] PATIENT: no .
[43] PATIENT: has n't bothered me one bit .
[44] DOCTOR: okay .
[45] DOCTOR: and any pain in your belly at all ?
[46] PATIENT: ca n't say that i have .
[47] DOCTOR: okay , sounds like you have been improving .
[48] DOCTOR: alrighty , mr .
[49] DOCTOR: watson , i'm going to step out of the room while my resident comes in to do a few tests for me .
[50] DOCTOR: is that all right ?
[51] PATIENT: sounds good .
[52] DOCTOR: okay , i'm going to go out and review the ct scan you had last month , and then we'll chat about it when i come in .
[53] DOCTOR: all righty , mr .
[54] DOCTOR: watson , so you definitely have made some improvements since the shunt surgery .
[55] DOCTOR: now on ct scan though i do believe i see a tiny bit of blood fluid collection in the right parietal region .
[56] DOCTOR: now , i do n't believe that that's causing any symptoms , and i , it actually was n't documented by the radiologist when he read the ct scan .
[57] PATIENT: so what does that mean ?
[58] DOCTOR: just that i would like to leave the shunt set for another two to three months before we go in changing it .
[59] DOCTOR: like i said , if you're not having any headaches or pain and you have improved so that's all good for me .
[60] DOCTOR: so really there's , there's nothing to worry about .
[61] PATIENT: all right so i'll come back in three months ?
[62] DOCTOR: yep , that's right .
[63] PATIENT: i do have a question for you though .
[64] DOCTOR: yeah , of course .
[65] PATIENT: do you think i will be able to drive again ?
[66] DOCTOR: ah man , mr .
[67] DOCTOR: watson , i knew you were gon na ask me that one .
[68] DOCTOR: i think at this point it's unlikely that your movement speed will improve to the level that would be needed for you to pass the driver safety evaluation .
[69] DOCTOR: now , i will say that i do occasionally have patients who surprise me by improving over a nine to 12 month range .
[70] DOCTOR: and that , that definitely could be you .
[71] DOCTOR: you could definitely pass it at that point .
[72] DOCTOR: so if you improve and we can continue to talk about that then , ya know , i think it could be possible , um , and i'd be happy to recommend it .
[73] DOCTOR: now , you could definitely also enroll in a driver safety program without my recommendation .
[74] DOCTOR: so you could kind of do that preemptively , and then we could continue to watch for your improvement as we go .
[75] PATIENT: okay .
[76] PATIENT: i kinda figured that anyway but i just thought i'd ask .
[77] PATIENT: i do n't like to burden anyone when i just need to run to the store but i also know that i need to be safe .
[78] DOCTOR: yeah , your safety is our number one priority and , ya know , i'm sure your daughters do n't mind as much , right , they want to keep you here and have you safe .
[79] DOCTOR: but , i overall am very pleased with how much you have improved .
[80] DOCTOR: and so , i'm sure when we talk again in three months , we'll continue to be on that upward trajectory or improvement .
[81] PATIENT: i sure hope so , doc .
[82] PATIENT: we really appreciate all that you've done .
[83] PATIENT: do we make the appointment out front ?
[84] DOCTOR: yeah , that would be great .
[85] DOCTOR: the girls up front will take care of you and get you settled for three months from now , and you both take care , all right ?
[86] PATIENT: thanks
[87] PATIENT: thank you .
[88] DOCTOR: all righty , so ros is constitutional significant for impaired ability to carry out daily functions .

[90] DOCTOR: gu is significant for urinary incontinence and wearing a diaper .

[92] DOCTOR: neurological significant for continued walking impairment and cognitive impairment .
[93] DOCTOR: negative for headaches , recent falls , or hallucinations .
[94] DOCTOR: psychiatric is negative for depression , excessive worrying , or mood swings .

[96] DOCTOR: vitals , let's see , blood pressure is 124/80 , heart rate 64 , respirations 18 , weight 174 pounds , and pain zero out of 10 .
[97] DOCTOR: mr .
[98] DOCTOR: watson is a pleasant and cooperative man who's able to converse easily through , um , though his daughter does add some details .
[99] DOCTOR: the shunt sight was clean , dry , and intact with a confirmed setting of two .
[100] DOCTOR: um he was tested um for recent and remote memory , attention span , and concentration in fund of knowledge .

[1] DOCTOR: all right , new patient , jordan roberts .
[2] DOCTOR: date of birth : 3/2/1972 .
[3] DOCTOR: he's a 49 year old , uh hm , with hypertension and palpitations .
[4] DOCTOR: please copy forward his thyroid profile from march 1st , 2021 .
[5] DOCTOR: hello mr. roberts , how are you doing today ?
[6] PATIENT: i'm fine , thank you .
[7] DOCTOR: good .
[8] DOCTOR: good .
[9] DOCTOR: so , i saw you were recently in the emergency room with high blood pressure and some palpitations .
[10] PATIENT: yeah .
[11] PATIENT: that was back in march i think , but my girlfriend and i , we talked about it , and on that day i had a few cups of coffee , and no breakfast .
[12] PATIENT: so , i think it was probably more of a panic attack than anything else .
[13] DOCTOR: yeah .
[14] DOCTOR: have you , uh , have you felt it again since ?
[15] PATIENT: uh , no .
[16] DOCTOR: okay .
[17] DOCTOR: uh , so tell me about the blood pressure then .
[18] PATIENT: well , i've had issues with my blood pressure since i was young .
[19] DOCTOR: do you have a family history of this ?
[20] PATIENT: yeah .
[21] PATIENT: a lot of my family does have high blood pressure .
[22] DOCTOR: i see .
[23] PATIENT: yeah , i thought it was getting better , and , uh , i have a new primary doctor , and she put me on a new medication about a month ago .
[24] DOCTOR: uh , can you tell me which medications you're taking ?
[25] PATIENT: my new med is , uh , a combo med , something 40-25 .
[26] DOCTOR: okay .
[27] DOCTOR: um .
[28] DOCTOR: yes , i see that in your chart .
[29] DOCTOR: the benicar hct .
[30] DOCTOR: it has hydrochlorothiazide in it .
[31] PATIENT: yeah , that's it .
[32] PATIENT: my water pill i call it .
[33] DOCTOR: okay .
[34] DOCTOR: are you still taking the amlodipine , 10 milligrams daily ?
[35] PATIENT: uh , yes i am .
[36] DOCTOR: that's- that's a good start on a regimen .
[37] DOCTOR: are you checking your blood pressure at home , and if yes , what numbers are you seeing ?
[38] PATIENT: um , every day .
[39] DOCTOR: awesome .
[40] PATIENT: yeah .
[41] PATIENT: every morning , i take it when i get up , and it's been running at about , uh , 146 to 155 lately .
[42] DOCTOR: so you're not down in the 120s yet ?
[43] PATIENT: no , not yet .
[44] PATIENT: well , we're trying to get there though .
[45] DOCTOR: okay .
[46] DOCTOR: uh , how are you doing with your salt intake ?
[47] PATIENT: i'm trying to back off of it .
[48] PATIENT: i think i'm doing good with it , not eating too much .
[49] DOCTOR: good , uh , it plays a huge part in lowering your pressure and , uh , staying away from salt is important .
[50] DOCTOR: um , i'll give you some information on the dash eating plan , which is the only eating plan that has been shown to lower blood pressure .
[51] PATIENT: sounds good .
[52] DOCTOR: are you doing any exercise ?
[53] PATIENT: i do try to walk on the treadmill when i can .
[54] DOCTOR: okay , great .
[55] DOCTOR: um , all right .
[56] DOCTOR: so , let's take a look .
[57] PATIENT: all right .
[58] DOCTOR: uh , you're gon na hear me talk throughout your exam , just so i can make sure i get everything documented .
[59] PATIENT: okay .
[60] DOCTOR: so , use my general physical exam template .
[61] DOCTOR: let me take a listen to you and make sure everything sounds good .
[62] PATIENT: all right .
[63] DOCTOR: your heart and lungs sound good , so that's great .
[64] PATIENT: good to hear .
[65] DOCTOR: all right .
[66] DOCTOR: go ahead and lie down .
[67] DOCTOR: uh , and let me know if anywhere i press hurts .
[68] PATIENT: nope .
[69] PATIENT: nowhere .
[70] DOCTOR: all right .
[71] DOCTOR: so , i'm gon na take a look at your ankles and feet .
[72] DOCTOR: i'm just gon na look for some swelling .
[73] PATIENT: all right .
[74] DOCTOR: all right .
[75] DOCTOR: it all looks good .
[76] DOCTOR: go ahead and sit up .
[77] DOCTOR: so , in terms of getting that pressure down , you're on three meds that are maxed out and your blood pressure is still not down .
[78] DOCTOR: and , the question is what do we need to do to get your- to get it down .
[79] DOCTOR: uh , your potassium one week ago was 4.0 .
[80] DOCTOR: uh , has it been redone since in the last week ?
[81] PATIENT: uh , no .
[82] DOCTOR: okay .
[83] DOCTOR: uh , four is good for your potassium level , some people have what is called resistant hypertension that is driven by something else in their body , uh , often it is a form , uh , hormonal response .
[84] DOCTOR: if i were to take 10 people under the age of 50 who have high blood pressure who developed it at a young age , eight out of 10 would respond to reduced salt in their diet with a lower blood pressure .
[85] DOCTOR: but , for the two out of 10 , there is something else driving it , uh , parathyroid levels or something called your adrenal glands overproduce , um , aldosterone , which we call hyperaldosterone .
[86] PATIENT: okay .
[87] PATIENT: so , is there something we can do about it ?
[88] DOCTOR: um , in these cases , there's medicine called , uh , spironolactone , that is very effective at dropping the ald- aldosterone level , and your blood pressure , and i think we should give that a try .
[89] PATIENT: all right .
[90] PATIENT: i mean , i'm willing to give it a try .
[91] DOCTOR: okay .
[92] DOCTOR: so , let's discuss the piss- the possible risk of , uh , being on hydrochlorothiazide , which is the fluid med that you're now on .
[93] DOCTOR: and , the spironolactone .
[94] DOCTOR: one issue is that they can affect your electrolyte balance .
[95] DOCTOR: um , they can also cause dehydration .
[96] DOCTOR: so , when ... so , you got ta make sure that you hydrate .
[97] DOCTOR: if you do not hydrate , and you get dehydrated , you will know it because you will get dizzy standing up .
[98] DOCTOR: um , second thing is the spironolactone can raise your potassium too far , it's rare , but it can .
[99] DOCTOR: uh , you're starting with your potassium at four , so that gives us some room .
[100] PATIENT: all right .
[101] PATIENT: i guess that makes me feel a little bit better .
[102] DOCTOR: yeah .
[103] DOCTOR: and then the third thing is that spironolactone combined with hydrocholorozide- chlorothiazide can cause your sodium levels to go down .
[104] DOCTOR: now , this does not mean- mean that you need to be eating more salt , okay ?
[105] DOCTOR: but , it does mean that you will need to do blood tests in two weeks to make sure that it's okay .
[106] PATIENT: all right .
[107] PATIENT: no , that i can do .
[108] PATIENT: um , are there any other side effects i need to worry about ?
[109] DOCTOR: uh , dizziness possibly , as well as , uh , one in 100 guys might develop tenderness in their chest , swollen breasts , or enlarged breasts .
[110] DOCTOR: this is a rare side effect , um , called gynecomastia , and if it happens , you just cut the medication and you let me know , but it is very uncommon .
[111] PATIENT: i'll definitely let you know if that happens .
[112] DOCTOR: okay .
[113] DOCTOR: uh , we'll keep working at it until your blood pressure gets better .
[114] DOCTOR: um , it can be tricky when your blood pressure starts to go up at a young age though , it is important to get it under control because it can lead to your heart getting bigger or enlarged .
[115] DOCTOR: um , same thing that happens when you lift weights and your muscles get bigger , uh , and if your heart pumps against high blood pressure , it can eventually lead to heart failure .
[116] PATIENT: i understand .
[117] DOCTOR: yeah , so getting that under control is really important to help prevent kidney failure , strokes , and- and things like that- that you're at high risk for with high blood pressure .
[118] PATIENT: okay .
[119] DOCTOR: um , the american heart association has a website called heart.org , it has a lot of really good information about blood pressure to teach- to teach you about it and how to control your diet with exercise .
[120] DOCTOR: um , if you do your treadmill routinely for 30 minutes or so most days , that could be seven to 10 points off your blood pressure .
[121] PATIENT: really ?
[122] PATIENT: i did n't realize that .
[123] DOCTOR: yeah , yeah .
[124] DOCTOR: it's very important to be active , lower your salt , and increase your potassium .
[125] DOCTOR: um , the goal is to keep your salt under 2000 milligrams a day , the actual recommendation is- is 1500 milligrams per day , but most people have a hard time with that .
[126] DOCTOR: um , so just take a look at the website and the dash diet information .
[127] DOCTOR: um , that will give you a lot of tips and information to help you start learning about this stuff .
[128] PATIENT: okay .
[129] PATIENT: i'll definitely check that out .
[130] DOCTOR: all right .
[131] DOCTOR: so , we'll try the spironolactone and schedule a followup in two weeks to check your blood pressure and electrolytes .
[132] DOCTOR: uh , if the new med does n't work , the next up is going to be the resistant hypertension clinic .
[133] PATIENT: all right .
[134] DOCTOR: all right .
[135] DOCTOR: so , there they will look into secondary causes of your hypertension .
[136] DOCTOR: they have access to newer procedure based technologies that can lower your blood pressure without medication , uh , for example , there is something called a renal , uh , denervation , uh , where they go inside the artery that feeds your kidney with almost like a little coil and heat that artery up .
[137] DOCTOR: when they do that , they can block the nerve endings that get into your kidneys and lower your blood pressure .
[138] PATIENT: that's interesting .
[139] DOCTOR: yeah .
[140] DOCTOR: so , that procedure has been shown to lower blood pressure by 10 points .
[141] DOCTOR: um , there are of course some risks , so not everyone is a candidate .
[142] DOCTOR: uh , but we'll cross that road , uh , when we need to , and let's just- let's just see how you do with the addition of the medication .
[143] PATIENT: sounds good to me .
[144] DOCTOR: all right .
[145] DOCTOR: so , we will see you in two weeks then .
[146] PATIENT: sounds good .
[147] PATIENT: thanks doc .
[148] DOCTOR: yeah , you're welcome .
[149] DOCTOR: let me know if you have any questions .
[150] PATIENT: will do .
[151] DOCTOR: all right .
[152] DOCTOR: have a great day mr. roberts .
[153] PATIENT: you too .
[154] DOCTOR: mr. roberts presents with resistant hypertension .
[155] DOCTOR: he's on three meds and maximum dose .
[156] DOCTOR: i have added spironolactone to his regiment .
[157] DOCTOR: we will need to monitor his potassium and sodium .
[158] DOCTOR: he will have a metabolic panel and blood pressure check in two weeks .
[159] DOCTOR: uh , next medication would be carvedilol , uh , which i try to avoid giving , it's potential for erectile dysfunction .
[160] DOCTOR: i have talked to the patient about that , and the potential side effects of spironolactone , including the gynecomastia and electrolyte disturbances .
[161] DOCTOR: if he is not controlled on spironolactone , the next step would be sending him to resistant hypertension clinic .assistant

[21] DOCTOR: okay , and was that your mom or dad's father ?
[22] PATIENT: mother's .
[23] DOCTOR: okay .
[24] DOCTOR: and , um , have you personally had any skin spots in the past that you got checked out and they were cancerous or precancerous ?
[25] PATIENT: no , this was the first time i've been to a dermatologist .
[26] PATIENT: um , but my primary care doctor looks over all of my moles every year at my physical and has n't said , um , he's concerned about any of 'em before .
[27] DOCTOR: good- good .
[28] DOCTOR: uh , let's go over your medical history from your chart .
[29] DOCTOR: i have that you're not taking any medications and do n't have any health problems listed , but that you're allergic to augmentin , is that right ?
[30] PATIENT: yes , that's correct .
[31] DOCTOR: okay , and for social history can you tell me what you do for work ?
[32] PATIENT: i own an auto repair shop .
[33] DOCTOR: okay and have you ever been a smoker ?
[34] PATIENT: yeah , i still smoke from time to time .
[35] PATIENT: i started that awful habit in my teens and it's hard to break , but i'm trying .
[36] DOCTOR: i'm glad you're trying to quit .
[37] DOCTOR: uh , what about your surgical history , have you had any surgeries ?
[38] PATIENT: i had gall bladder and appendix .
[39] DOCTOR: okay , great , we can get your chart up to date now , thank you .
[40] DOCTOR: and other than the melanoma , how has your health been , any unintentional weight changes , headaches , fatigue , nausea , vomiting , vision changes ?
[41] PATIENT: no , i've been feelin' great .
[42] DOCTOR: good .
[43] DOCTOR: well let me take a look at your back here where they did the biopsy if you do n't mind .
[44] PATIENT: sure .
[45] DOCTOR: okay , i'm gon na describe it in medical jargon what i'm seeing here , so that the recording can capture it , but you and i are gon na go over it together in just a moment , okay ?
[46] PATIENT: okay , that's fine .
[47] DOCTOR: all right , so on the right inferior back there's a one centimeter shave biopsy site , including all of the dermis with no residual pigmentation .
[48] DOCTOR: there's no intrinsic or satellite lesions , no other suspicious moles , no axillary , cervical , or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy .
[49] DOCTOR: there is a soft lymph node in the right groin , but it's nontender , otherwise normal exam .
[50] DOCTOR: okay , you can sit up .
[51] DOCTOR: um , so what i was saying there is that i see your biopsy site , but i do n't see any other s- , um , skin lumps or bumps that look suspicious .
[52] DOCTOR: uh , i also felt your lymph nodes to see if any of them felt abnormal .
[53] DOCTOR: there is one in the right groin that felt slightly abnormal .
[54] DOCTOR: it's very likely nothing , but i do want you to have an ultrasound of that area to confirm it's nothing , um , and , you know , make sure it's nothing that we need to worry about .
[55] DOCTOR: uh , the reason we're being extra cautious is that melanoma can very rarely metastasize to the lymph nodes .
[56] DOCTOR: the ultrasound can tell us if we need to look into this further .
[57] PATIENT: okay , i should n't worry too much then ?
[58] DOCTOR: no , i have a low suspicion that it will show anything .
[59] PATIENT: okay , good .
[60] DOCTOR: so assuming that the ultrasound is normal , the treatment for you melanoma is to cut out the area where the lesion was .
[61] DOCTOR: with lesions that are 0.7 millimeters or less , um , and that's what we recommend , and yours was exactly 0.7 millimeters .
[62] DOCTOR: if it were any bigger , we would have had to do a more complex surgery .
[63] DOCTOR: but what i recommend for you is what we call a wide local incision , excuse me , excision , meaning that i will make a long incision and then cut out an area a bit wider than your current biopsy site .
[64] DOCTOR: the incision is long because that's what allows me to close the skin nicely .
[65] DOCTOR: you'll have a fairly long scar from the incision .
[66] PATIENT: okay , that is fine with me , i ca n't see back there anyways .
[67] DOCTOR: yeah , your wife can tell you what it looks like and she may need to help care for the incision at it , as it heals .
[68] DOCTOR: um , but since we're , we are n't doing the more complex surgery , i actually do n't need to see you back unless you want to check in with me or have any problems .
[69] DOCTOR: however , it is very important that you continue to follow up with your dermatologist regularly so she can monitor you .
[70] DOCTOR: uh , your dermatologist will check that this one does n't come back , but she'll also check for other lesions that look suspicious .
[71] DOCTOR: uh , unfortunately , since you've had one melanoma , you're at a higher risk of developing another one somewhere else .
[72] PATIENT: yeah , she did say she wants to see me back .
[73] DOCTOR: good , and i'm sure she's already told you , but it's very important that you apply sunscreen anytime and anywhere that your skin is exposed to sunlight .
[74] PATIENT: yeah , she definitely went over that , um , several times with me .
[75] DOCTOR: good .
[76] DOCTOR: other than that , i think that's all for me .
[77] DOCTOR: um , we'll get you set up for the ultrasound , the procedure .
[78] DOCTOR: do you have any questions for me ?
[79] PATIENT: um , no i ca n't think of any at this time .
[80] DOCTOR: okay , my nurse will be in to get you scheduled , so sit tight .
[81] DOCTOR: it was very good to meet you .
[82] PATIENT: thank you , nice to meet you as well .
[83] DOCTOR: please add the following pathology r- , to results .
[84] DOCTOR: a pathology , shave of right inferior back , malignant melanoma , invasive , superficial spreading .
[85] DOCTOR: histology , superficial spreading .
[86] DOCTOR: clark level 4 , breslow thickness 0.7 millimeters , radial growth phase present , vertical growth phase not identified .
[87] DOCTOR: mitotic features , less than one millimeter squared .
[88] DOCTOR: ulceration not identified , progression not identified , lymphatic invasion not identified , perineural invasion not identified , microscopic satellitosis not identified .
[89] DOCTOR: infiltrating , uh , lymphocytes , breast .
[90] DOCTOR: um , melanocytic nevus not identified .
[91] DOCTOR: predominant cytology epithelioid , peripheral margin positive , deep margin , uh , negative , stage 1 .
[92] DOCTOR: also note that i reviewed the dermatologist's photo of the lesion which showed an asymmetric black and brown nevus with central a melanotic component and irregular border .
[93] DOCTOR: for assessment and plan , the patient presents today with newly diagnosed melanoma .
[94] DOCTOR: biopsy revealed an intermediate thickness melanoma .
[95] DOCTOR: on examination today , there is right inguinal lymph node with slightly atypical consistency .
[96] DOCTOR: i recommended an ultrasound to rule out metastatic disease .
[97] DOCTOR: if the ultrasound is normal , the patient is a candidate for wide local excision with a one to two centimeter margin .
[98] DOCTOR: primary closure should be possible , but skin graft closure may be needed .
[99] DOCTOR: the relationship between tumor histology and prognosis and treatment was carefully reviewed .
[100] DOCTOR: the need for follow-up , according to the national comprehensive cancer network guidelines , was reviewed .
[101] DOCTOR: we also reviewed the principles of sun avoidance , skin self-examination , and the abcdes of mole surveillance .
[102] DOCTOR: after discussing the procedure , risk and expected outcomes , and possible complications , questions were answered and the patient expressed understanding and did choose to proceed .assistant

[19] DOCTOR: alright and have you had any in the past or is this your first one
[20] PATIENT: this is my first time i've never had this before
[21] DOCTOR: okay alright so we'll do we'll do an exam on you just to check you out so i guess you were in pain and stuff over the over the easter easter break there that
[22] PATIENT: yeah yeah i had some pain over the weekend i saw my pediatrician this morning so they sent me over here they were concerned that i might have a kidney stone
[23] DOCTOR: okay so i'm guessing you did n't get to go find the eggs on the easter egg hunt because of the you were in pain
[24] PATIENT: not so much but i i got to participate a little bit i opened some eggs i just did n't go run around and find them
[25] DOCTOR: okay well i i'm lucky enough my friends had an adult easter hag hunt for me and so i was able to find a couple eggs yesterday myself so i i'm glad you were able to get a few of them alright so let's do that that physical exam on you so your vitals look good you do n't have any fever your blood pressure heart rate is fine so when i press here on your belly does that hurt
[26] PATIENT: a little bit yeah
[27] DOCTOR: a little bit alright so on your exam of your abdomen there is mild pain and tenderness to palpation of the abdomen there's no rebound or guarding there is cva located near your flank tenderness on the right so that means that everything looks good but you do have what seems to be some inflammation of your kidney okay so we we were able to get a ct of your your side and it showed that you do have a stone measuring point five centimeters in size and it's located in the proximal right ureter and so that's that duck that passes from your kidney to your bladder alright i do n't see any evidence of hydronephrosis so that means that there's not obstructing ureter causing swelling in your kidney which is which is pretty good so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan so you do have that kidney stone on the right so what i'm recommending is i want you to push fluids just to help facilitate you passing that stone alright have you been taking in have you been drinking enough water do you think so far
[28] PATIENT: probably not enough i drink some but
[29] DOCTOR: okay yeah i i want you to to drink try drink as much as possible just to see if we can get you hydrated and pass the stone what i'm gon na do is i'm gon na prescribe you ibuprofen eight hundred milligrams you can take that as needed for pain i know you said you were in that much pain just in case it does start to move you're in pain i want you to take the ibuprofen i'm also gon na give you a strainer for you to strain your pee so we can see you wan na know when that that stone does pass gon na order a bmp and a urinalysis and a urine culture and based on what the urinalysis shows we can decide if i can decide if i need to put you on antibiotics if you do have an infection of some kind and i wan na see you back in about a week to two weeks and if you're still having symptoms we can discuss further treatment such as a lithotripsy and it's it's a mainly minimally invasive procedure where we use shock waves to try to break up that stone but otherwise do you have any other questions for me
[30] PATIENT: no i do n't think so

[28] PATIENT: not recently just back to wisconsin but no unusual travel or other exposures
[29] DOCTOR: okay alright great and okay so so tell me about your migraines how have they been are you still taking the sumatriptan you know as needed when when you developed migraine you have have you had a migraine recently
[30] PATIENT: i have not usually they are responsive to just excedrin migraine i use the sumatriptan when i need to if it if it does n't respond to the over the counter analgesic
[31] DOCTOR: okay
[32] PATIENT: so
[33] DOCTOR: okay
[34] PATIENT: it's it's been it they've been pretty rare
[35] DOCTOR: okay okay great yeah you've learned a lot about it and and the treatments including the the term analgesic and all of that that's pretty impressive you've been you've been through the ringer i think with with those so okay and so you're taking excedrin when you get a migraine and then sort of would you say maybe for breakthrough migraines or worse migraines you'd take a sumatriptan occasionally
[36] PATIENT: yeah
[37] DOCTOR: okay got it and how about your blood pressure how has that been running at home are you checking your blood pressures daily still and how how your how how have your blood pressures been
[38] PATIENT: i have not been checking them daily i i probably check it about two or three times a week
[39] DOCTOR: hmmm
[40] PATIENT: and they're pretty good the upper number is usually around in the one twenties or low one thirties and the lower number usually in the seventies
[41] DOCTOR: okay okay not not too bad it does look like you're a little bit elevated today i i maybe i'm just making you nervous though so i hope not so are you but you're still on lisinopril twenty milligrams per day correct it looks like you might be running low do you need a refill of that
[42] PATIENT: yeah actually i was going to ask you about that if i could get a refill that would be great
[43] DOCTOR: sure we can do that and so okay but you are still taking that twenty milligrams per day correct
[44] PATIENT: correct
[45] DOCTOR: okay and alright fair enough so so let's go ahead and and examine you now karen so on your physical exam pretty normal and and unremarkable for the most part on your on your heart exam i do hear that grade three out of six systolic ejection murmur that you've still got that's unchanged from prior exam that just means i hear some heart sounds you know as i'm listening to your heart there i'm not too concerned about that we'll watch that otherwise normal cardiovascular exam and then your your abdominal exam gastrointestinal exam you have some tenderness in the right upper quadrant i would say mild to moderate tenderness and now if you take a deep breath does that and i press here does that hurt you
[46] PATIENT: yes
[47] DOCTOR: okay yeah you have i would call an equivocal murphy's sign in the right upper quadrant on your abdominal examination as well the rest of your abdomen is soft and no significant tenderness you have no tenderness in the right lower quadrant with deep palpation and you have no cva tenderness on your back exam as well and so we will talk about about that i am a little bit concerned about the tenderness that that i find on your abdominal exam the remainder of your exam karen is pretty normal and unremarkable and and so that's good let's let's talk about my assessment and your plan so first of all for your first problem of abdominal pain you you do seem to have acute abdominal pain with right upper quadrant tenderness that i'm concerned maybe a sign of some gallstones or possibly even an infection in your gallbladder so i'm gon na order some blood tests and an ultrasound today i'm gon na order a cbc chem twelve urinalysis a pregnancy test and also right upper quadrant ultrasound and so we will we will get those tests done right away i'm gon na keep you here we'll see how those look fortunately we've got the facilities for those and if we need to send you to the emergency department based on those results we will i do n't want you to eat anything right now okay in case we find something that might require surgery alright unlikely but it's possible and then okay you know karen i meant to ask you on your history one thing by chance have you had a fever along with this abdominal pain
[48] PATIENT: i've had some chills but no documented fevers
[49] DOCTOR: okay alright alright good yeah i i see you do n't have a fever today so that's that's good and so alright now for your second problem the migraine headaches you you do have a history of chronic migraines and and you have occasional bouts of of migraines nothing recent so let's continue the excedrin as needed over the counter for treatment there and then also the sumatriptan as needed for breakthrough migraine pain and i i would just encourage you to continue to avoid alcohol binges and caffeine binges and try to get enough sleep and all of that's easier said than done i know so but but that seems to be helping you now for your third problem of hypertension your blood pressure seems to be under adequate control so that's good we'll continue you on the lisinopril twenty milligrams per day and i will write you a refill prescription for that and send that to the pharmacy please continue to check your blood pressures daily so karen how does that all sound for a plan any other questions for me
[50] PATIENT: i actually do need a refill on my sumatriptan as well
[51] DOCTOR: okay alright sure yeah no problem so for your migraines the migraine problem i'm also gon na write you that that refill prescription for sumatriptan and anything else you can think of
[52] PATIENT: no the plan sounds good

[28] PATIENT: yeah , it does .
[29] DOCTOR: okay , and does it- does it go away if you- if you rest ?
[30] PATIENT: yeah , it does actually .
[31] DOCTOR: okay , all right .

[33] PATIENT: no i do n't .

[35] DOCTOR: okay , and- and can you describe it ?
[36] PATIENT: it's like a burn .
[37] DOCTOR: okay .
[38] PATIENT: it it just feels like it's burning , um , nothing terribly concerning , not enough to send me to the er , but i do notice it .
[39] DOCTOR: okay , and where exactly is it located in your chest ?
[40] PATIENT: just , um , right in the middle ...
[41] DOCTOR: okay .

[45] PATIENT: um , probably about three- three times a week .
[46] DOCTOR: okay , all right .
[47] DOCTOR: well i'm glad that you talked about that with me today , um , i know the nurse did a review of systems sheet with you , and , you know , you're obviously endorsing this- this chest pressure .
[48] DOCTOR: um , have you had any other symptoms , i know the- the other ones that you have n't had , but any lower extremity edema , or muscle aches , or fever chills ?
[49] PATIENT: no , nothing like that , but i have had a little bit of congestion , um , just from allergies , because of the pollen .
[50] DOCTOR: okay , so you're endorsing some nasal congestion ?
[51] PATIENT: yeah .
[52] DOCTOR: all right , well let's go ahead and we'll do a physical exam , okay ?
[53] PATIENT: okay .
[54] DOCTOR: hey dragon ?
[55] DOCTOR: show me the vital signs .
[56] DOCTOR: so here your vital signs look really good , i'm- i'm happy to see that your blood pressure is under- under good control , and your oxygenation is fine , so i'm just gon na take a listen to your heart and lungs , and i'll let you know if i find anything , okay ?
[57] PATIENT: okay .
[58] DOCTOR: okay , so in physical exam your heart has a slight three out of six systolic ejection murmur , which we've heard before .
[59] DOCTOR: your lungs are nice and clear , uh , i do n't appreciate any carotid bruits , and- and you have no lower extremity edema , you have healed , uh , surgical scars on your- on your , uh , right wrist .
[60] DOCTOR: um , so let's go ahead , i wan na look at some of your results , okay ?
[61] PATIENT: okay .
[62] DOCTOR: hey dragon , show me the echocardiogram ?
[63] DOCTOR: so this is the echocardiogram from last year , you know , you did have a slightly low pumping function of your heart at 45 % , but , uh , i- , you know , i suspected that will improve over time , and you did have some slight , what we call , mitral regurgitation , that's just a leaky heart valve , and that's that murmur that i heard .
[64] DOCTOR: hey dragon , show me the ecg ?
[65] DOCTOR: and here , you know , in reviewing your results of your e- ecg , you know , it looks stable , it just kinda reflects your prior coronary artery disease .
[66] DOCTOR: there's no new changes , which is good , so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you .

[68] DOCTOR: for your next problem , your herniated disc , that also sounds like your doing really well , i do n't think that we need to refer you for any further steroid injection , or physical therapy at this time .
[69] DOCTOR: so , if you have recurrent symptoms , i want you to let me know .
[70] DOCTOR: and finally , your last problem , the most concerning problem to me is your known coronary artery disease , and this recurrent chest pain you have .
[71] DOCTOR: so , i wan na go ahead and continue you on your asprin , and your toprol , okay ?
[72] DOCTOR: i wan na go ahead and order a stress test for you to see if you have more blockages that could be causing this chest discomfort , okay ?

[12] PATIENT: not that i want
[13] DOCTOR: okay yeah i mean i think we all like to lose a little bit of weight but yeah it's a it says it's a struggle so no no chest pain or shortness of breath with this
[14] PATIENT: no
[15] DOCTOR: okay so i i'm gon na you know we'll talk about that in a second i'll look at your throat as well and see what we need to do but it sounds like we may have to send you to a specialist to take a look at that and see if there is something causing this how about how are you doing with your diabetes by the way since i have n't seen you in a while i know we have you on metformin five hundred milligrams twice a day we checked your hemoglobin a1c last time was seven .
[16] DOCTOR: four we talked about improving your diet and exercise how are things going
[17] PATIENT: i think they're going great i mean i'm taking my meds i'm sticking to them and i feel pretty good otherwise
[18] DOCTOR: okay are you checking your blood sugars in the morning or are you checking those at all
[19] PATIENT: yeah i do i mean once in a while i i'm in a hurry and i skip it but i have to say i probably do so about eighty percent of the time
[20] DOCTOR: and how are the numbers looking
[21] PATIENT: they're looking you know okay they are all within you know the range that we are targeting
[22] DOCTOR: okay alright and any any no nausea vomiting or diarrhea or any other side effects from the metformin or anything like that
[23] PATIENT: no
[24] DOCTOR: okay good so i think we should probably repeat your hemoglobin a1c it sounds like you've you know you've improved your diet and it sounds like you've you're following the regimen so maybe the numbers will be better this time and we do n't have to change your medication so that will be awesome how are you doing with your blood pressure i know we have you on norvasc we asked that you check it like you know once a week or more than that if you have time blood pressure looks good today in the office it's about one fifty i'm sorry one twenty over fifty right now so no nothing here in the office how are things at home
[25] PATIENT: i get there now every once in a while you know the lower numbers a little bit you know higher but it's not you know usually it's either close or or on on range
[26] DOCTOR: okay alright good so let me examine you now so tyler i'm examining you now i'm gon na just verbalize some of my findings your neck is fine i do n't see any swelling in your neck your thyroid feels normal i do n't feel any masses in your neck there's no lymph nodes i'm looking at your throat and that looks okay there is no masses or any swelling that i can see there is no redness yeah there is no carotid bruit your lung exam is clear your heart exam is normal no murmurs on your belly exam you have some epigastric tenderness right here in the right here where i'm pressing but i do n't feel any masses or any significant swelling back there no normal back exam your extremity exam looks normal your neurological exam's fine so for this difficulty swallowing i'm concerned that you may have a narrowing in your throat that's causing this and sometimes it can be from a stricture where some narrowing of the esophagus and sometimes i need to go in and dilate that so i'm gon na go ahead and send you give you a referral for gastroenterology and have them do a scope and take a look down there i'm gon na recommend we put you on some prilosec sometimes also reflux medicine can if you have reflux sometimes that can also exacerbate this sometimes so i'm gon na put you on some prilosec twenty milligrams once a day again i'm gon na recommend that you chew your foods frequently and make sure you have a you know especially if you're eating something hard like steak or meat chew them really well so they do n't get tend to get stuck some people have sometimes things get stuck and they do n't go down and if that happens as an emergency you do have to go to the emergency department but seems like you know things are going down they just seem to sometimes slow down or get stuck temporarily so why do n't i get you a referral for gi we will start you on the prilosec and then we will have you you know if you you know if you have any other symptoms or worsenings give my office a call we will get you in or get you referred to the er if needed any questions about that
[27] PATIENT: no that sounds great
[28] DOCTOR: okay and for the diabetes i'm gon na order another hemoglobin a1c i'm gon na order some more blood work today we'll check a kidney function and i notice that you have not had an eye referral so i'm gon na also give you an eye referral to ophthalmology to check your eyes for your diabetic for your for any retinopathy continue the metformin i'll have you come back in about a month and that way we'll have the results back for the blood test if we need to make any adjustments we can but i i wan na see you back in about a month and i think that's it for that any questions about that
[29] PATIENT: no
[30] DOCTOR: okay and the high blood pressure i think you're doing great continue with the norvasc if you have any issues certainly call me but otherwise there is really nothing else to add for that did we forget anything or do you need refills for anything
[31] PATIENT: you know i think i'm low on the norvasc so if you could send something to my pharmacy that would be great

[34] PATIENT: ra i'm not suspicious but we're just gon na go with that okay because looking at your vitals it it is of still a bit high i'm not really comfortable i see like a hundred and eighty over you know eighty and
[35] DOCTOR: that's not where we wan na be so i wonder if we might need to adjust your medication but let's talk about your diabetes how are your blood sugars
[36] PATIENT: i think they're little bit better
[37] DOCTOR: okay what makes you think that have you been taking them
[38] PATIENT: yeah i check it you know most days again kinda when i remember

[43] DOCTOR: okay and then i think we have you on five hundred milligrams correct
[44] PATIENT: yes

[49] DOCTOR: okay and are you do you know if you're particularly focused on your salt like is it like a low salt diet
[50] PATIENT: no just trying to watch my carbs a little bit more but not counting or anything
[51] DOCTOR: alright so like is it a specific diet i just wan na make sure like are you on like the keto diet
[52] PATIENT: no
[53] DOCTOR: okay alright not a problem so if you do n't mind i'm gon na go ahead and do a quick physical exam as i mentioned before your blood pressure is a little high as i listen to your heart i do like it's got a nice regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmur when i listen to your lungs they sound clear bilaterally i would like to look at your knee though so when i press here on the outside does it hurt
[54] PATIENT: little bit
[55] DOCTOR: okay and then when i press on the inside does it hurt
[56] PATIENT: no
[57] DOCTOR: alright can you bend your knee and straighten it

[59] DOCTOR: mm-hmm alright so are you having problems walking can you bear weight
[60] PATIENT: i can but i have a little bit of a limp
[61] DOCTOR: okay so do you mind getting up and walking for me really quickly alright so i do notice that there is a slight gait like there is a small sorry you are correcting you do have a limp i i am a little worried about that but it's probably it's probably the superficial when i'm looking at your knee i do notice some like ecchymosis and edema that just means bruising and swelling along the lateral aspect of your knee i do n't notice any effusion and it looks like you have a decent range of motion but i do understand that you know you are experiencing pain with some movement okay i'm gon na go ahead and order an x-ray and when you come back we can have that discussion alright so i reviewed the results of your right knee x-ray which showed no evidence of fracture or bony abnormality so let's talk about my assessment and plan alright so for your first problem of right knee pain i think you have a lateral a lateral ligament strain i wan na prescribe some meloxicam which is gon na be fifteen milligrams daily for pain and swelling i'm gon na refer you to physical therapy to help strengthen the muscles around the area and to prevent further injury if you're still having pain we can do further imaging imaging but like this is a common injury that tends to heal on its own for your second problem with hypertension i wan na continue the lisinopril at twenty milligrams and order an echo i am concerned that we might not be getting your blood pressure to where we need it to be so we might have to do some medication modification for your third problem with diabetes i wan na order an a1c i know that you said you have been measuring your blood sugars but i think this would give us a better image of what's been happening long term and i also wan na order a lipid panel in case we need to make any adjustments to that medication as well do you have any questions

[120] PATIENT: No.
[121] DOCTOR: No.
[122] DOCTOR: Alright.
[123] DOCTOR: OK.
[124] DOCTOR: So um, what I think we should do, with regards to your elbow problem
[125] DOCTOR: OK. Is um, I think, it would be worthwhile.
[126] DOCTOR: , this seems like uh, what we call the Bursitis.
[127] DOCTOR: OK.
[128] DOCTOR: So, that's an inflammation of one of the fluid sacs around the joint.
[129] DOCTOR: Um, what I think we should do is, I think you should be on some anti-inflammatory medication, in the, in the first instance.
[130] PATIENT: OK.
[131] DOCTOR: And, as well as that, what I would like to do, is to get some blood tests done, to check for other types of uh, causes of joint swelling.
[132] DOCTOR: K?
[133] PATIENT: Alright.
[134] DOCTOR: So, um, what we're going to do is, we're going to arrange some, um, blood test forms to be sent out to your house.
[135] DOCTOR: And, there'll be instructions within that pack, about where to go to get those blood tests done.
[136] DOCTOR: And, that will involve you, um, having some tests done to check for inflammatory markers, infection, rheumatological antibodies.
[137] DOCTOR: So we'll do a full screen, and also check for things like Gout as well, OK. Um.
[138] PATIENT: OK.
[139] DOCTOR: The time frame for that, will be um, the results will come back to us after about five or six days.
[140] DOCTOR: Um.
[141] PATIENT: K .
[142] PATIENT: O
[143] DOCTOR: From now, but it may take time for the form to come out to you.
[144] DOCTOR: And if you get the form get the blood tests done straight away, by the time that we're expecting result back, you know one or two days after that, we're looking maybe six days.
[145] DOCTOR: And, what I would suggest, is, we can arrange a follow-up appointment for you, in one of our clinics, where we can have a look at your joint, feel it, we can review the blood test.
[146] PATIENT: OK.
[147] DOCTOR: Uh, we can um, get a gauge as to, uh, what's going on.
[148] DOCTOR: Now in terms of your joint right now,
[149] DOCTOR: It doesn't look like, to me that's something called, excuse me, septic arthritis.
[150] DOCTOR: So, we're worried sometimes that someone might have an acutely infected joint.
[151] PATIENT: Mm-hmm.
[152] DOCTOR: Um, and uh, your, your joint doesn't look like that.
[153] PATIENT: Yeah.
[154] DOCTOR: However, if your, the elbow was to become very red, very painful, uh, and the redness was to spread or become uh, you know more intense.
[155] DOCTOR: Then you need to get on the phone or get, have a video appointment , with one of us as soon as possible.
[156] PATIENT: OK.
[157] DOCTOR: 'Cause that would be an emergency.
[158] DOCTOR: That would require more immediate assessment, more immediate treatment.
[159] DOCTOR: OK?
[160] PATIENT: do you, do you think it's something dangerous?
[161] PATIENT: Like something, like could I die from that, or is it, is it
[162] DOCTOR: No.
[163] DOCTOR: I, I don't think this is anything dangerous.
[164] DOCTOR: don't need to worry.
[165] DOCTOR: OK?
[166] DOCTOR: What I'm doing, is I'm just outlining the worst case scenario if things were to, to develop.
[167] DOCTOR: K?
[168] DOCTOR: So, , this, this is not the case right now.
[169] DOCTOR: Right now, it looks quite straightforward.
[170] PATIENT: OK.
[171] PATIENT: Yeah, OK, I see.
[172] DOCTOR: It's nothing , sinister or life-threatening.
[173] DOCTOR: Um, what I'm doing is I'm just saying, in case things worsen, these are the things that we'd be looking out for, and this is what we have to do.
[174] DOCTOR: But you don't have that now, thankfully, and I don't think you're going to have it.
[175] PATIENT: OK.
[176] DOCTOR: But I'm just saying, the what if scenario.
[177] DOCTOR: Is that OK?
[178] PATIENT: Yeah that, that sounds good.
[179] PATIENT: Thank you.
[180] DOCTOR: All right.
[181] DOCTOR: Did you have any questions that you wanted to ask me?
[182] PATIENT: Um, well just yeah I just wanted to know about this.
[183] PATIENT: Um, yeah it feels a bit better now .
[184] PATIENT: Uh, but yeah, no that's it.
[185] PATIENT: Thank you.
[186] DOCTOR: OK, all right.
[187] DOCTOR: Um.
[188] DOCTOR: OK.
[189] DOCTOR: So, I, I would take Ibuprofen regularly, OK. You can get that , over the counter.
[190] DOCTOR: Um, that's four hundred milligrams, two times a day.
[191] DOCTOR: And you should take, take that after food, not on an empty stomach.
[192] DOCTOR: If you get any heartburn, stop taking it.
[193] DOCTOR: OK.
[194] PATIENT: OK.
[195] PATIENT: Sure.
[196] PATIENT: thanks.
[197] PATIENT: Bye.
[198] DOCTOR: All right.
[199] DOCTOR: So, what I wanna do is, I'll get the forms sent out to you.
[200] DOCTOR: And, um, we are going to arrange a, a follow-up appointment.
[201] DOCTOR: Maybe within a um, actually you know, the follow-up appointment doesn't have to be face-to-face, if it's more convenient for you do, to do it over the phone, we can do that over the phone, uh, over video.
[202] DOCTOR: We can do that as well, that's, that's your call.
[203] DOCTOR: But you contact us, , after you've had the blood test done, and we can review things then, OK.
[204] PATIENT: OK.
[205] PATIENT: OK, yeah that sounds good.
[206] PATIENT: I, I'll do that.
[207] PATIENT: And if I see that it's getting worse, I'll probably ask for a physical appointment.
[208] DOCTOR: Sure, sure that's a good idea.
[209] DOCTOR: All right then, OK. Um, take care then.
[210] DOCTOR: So , look just leave that with me, I'll sort all those bits and pieces out, and then we'll get them sent out to you, and then we'll, we'll um, review you after the tests, things goes well, OK.
[211] PATIENT: Thank you.
[212] PATIENT: Alright.
[213] PATIENT: Sounds
[214] DOCTOR: All right then.
[215] DOCTOR: Take care then, all the best.

[92] DOCTOR: .
[93] DOCTOR: Not everyone can do this, so don't worry if you can't.
[94] DOCTOR: But if you, if you can tell me whether you can feel the regular pulse.

[110] DOCTOR: If you can stop now, .
[111] DOCTOR: That, I think that was about eleven or twelve.
[112] DOCTOR: Um, so that would make your heart rate about, sixty six to seventy four, that's, that's OK, good.
[113] DOCTOR: Fantastic.
[114] DOCTOR: And the next thing I'd like you to try and do, OK. Um, it depends on the lighting, so it may not be possible.
[115] DOCTOR: But the next thing I'd like you to try and do is just, to get you to squeeze the tip of your finger.
[116] DOCTOR: And then let me see how quickly the redness come back.
[117] DOCTOR: OK, so if you can see what I'm doing now.
[118] DOCTOR: My finger's come, right behind the screen, I'm squeezing it, OK. , just watch me first, it's all right, just watch me first.
[119] DOCTOR: Yeah, I'm, I'm squeezing it.
[120] DOCTOR: And then you can see, that, it goes, pale and then it goes back to the normal red colour, OK.
[121] DOCTOR: So if I can get you just to put your finger up to the, your camera.
[122] DOCTOR: And then with the other hand, just try and squeeze it, and see.
[123] PATIENT: You look like you've got very good circulation.
[124] DOCTOR: OK, perfect, that's great.
[125] DOCTOR: Thank you so much.
[126] DOCTOR: The last thing I'd like to do, is I'd like , to , try and have a look down your throat.

[153] PATIENT: Um, Doris.
[154] DOCTOR: Doris, OK Doris.
[155] DOCTOR: Um, so, so Doris, um, what, what I think we need to do, is um.
[156] DOCTOR: This sounds like you might have a chest infection.
[157] DOCTOR: OK.
[158] DOCTOR: If you're coughing up blood, and you're feeling your heart racing.
[159] DOCTOR: Um.
[160] DOCTOR: Uh, I think, you need to be examined today, someone needs to listen to your chest.
[161] DOCTOR: And, um, maybe check your blood pressure as well, check that, you're stable.
[162] DOCTOR: I have to say examining you now, from what limited, examination I could do online.
[163] DOCTOR: You're, everything does seem to be OK, in terms of, you, you don't seem acutely unstable.
[164] DOCTOR: However, if you've got, this kind of pain, um, when taking a deep breath in and you're coughing up blood.
[165] DOCTOR: We do, do, we do need to assess you to figure out whether you have a Pneumonia or chest infection.
[166] DOCTOR: And um, that would involve someone listening to your chest with a stethoscope, and you may need um, an antibiotic.
[167] DOCTOR: Uh, there's one thing I need to ask you.
[168] DOCTOR: Have you been, on any long-haul flight recently?
[169] PATIENT: No, no.
[170] DOCTOR: No, OK. Have you ever had any clots in your legs, or clots in your lung?
[171] DOCTOR: Blood clots?
[172] PATIENT: Not that I know of, no.
[173] DOCTOR: No, OK.
[174] DOCTOR: Anyone in the family have that?
[175] PATIENT: No.
[176] DOCTOR: No, OK. All right.
[177] DOCTOR: Um, what I think we'll do is um, we'll arrange for you to get reviewed in a clinic today.
[178] DOCTOR: OK. Um, I would like someone to listen to your chest, and check your blood pressure.
[179] DOCTOR: And to, to recheck your pulse as well.
[180] DOCTOR: Just make sure, and check your temperature, make sure all those parameters are OK.
[181] DOCTOR: You may well need an antibiotic, OK. Um, do you have any allergies to any antibiotics?
[182] PATIENT: No.
[183] DOCTOR: No, OK. Um, I, I'm not, I'm gonna, not, I'm not going to prescribe anything for you now, because I think you need to have that, basic assessment first.
[184] DOCTOR: Um, before we proceed to the next step.
[185] DOCTOR: But the, that's what I would predict the next step might be.
[186] DOCTOR: Um, I'm going to leave the number in the notes for this appointment, for you to ring our support team.
[187] DOCTOR: And then, they will, book you in for a face-to-face appointment with one of our GPs today.
[188] DOCTOR: And then, they'll do that assessment, and then we'll take it from there, OK.
[189] PATIENT: OK.
[190] PATIENT: But we don't think I'm dying of lung cancer.
[191] DOCTOR: Um, uh, given the, the way in which you uh, have presented now.
[192] DOCTOR: Just one day, with a fever and, this slight pain, , concurrent with the, the blood in the, the, the flem.
[193] DOCTOR: That's not usually how lung cancer is presented.
[194] DOCTOR: It's more insidious, over a longer period of time, with other symptoms.
[195] DOCTOR: Um, however, we might need to get some investigations to exclude that.
[196] DOCTOR: It depends on the examination finding, when we see you.
[197] PATIENT: OK.
[198] DOCTOR: All right.
[199] DOCTOR: , are you worried about lung cancer?
[200] PATIENT: Well you know, you start coughing up blood and you think you're, gonna, die of lung cancer, so.
[201] DOCTOR: .
[202] DOCTOR: Sure, of course yeah.
[203] DOCTOR: So, just remind me how old you are again.
[204] DOCTOR: I'm sorry.
[205] PATIENT: Forty five.
[206] DOCTOR: Forty five, OK.
[207] DOCTOR: It's something we do need to be cognisant of, OK. Um, and, we may end up having to do a follow-up chest X-ray, if things don't settle down.
[208] DOCTOR: But at the moment, it, it seems more like a chest infection, rather than a lung cancer.
[209] PATIENT: That's good to know.
[210] DOCTOR: Yeah, that, that is good to know, yeah, so that's, 'cause that's easier to treat.
[211] DOCTOR: But we still need to make sure that things are OK because, chest infections can become nasty as well.
[212] DOCTOR: It can lead to infection inside the body, , we want to avoid that as well.
[213] DOCTOR: So, let's get you checked out today, and hopefully we can put your mind to rest, and get you on the right course of treatment.
[214] PATIENT: Yep.
[215] PATIENT: Perfect.
[216] PATIENT: Thank you very much.
[217] DOCTOR: All right, you're welcome.
[218] DOCTOR: All right, take care then.
[219] DOCTOR: All the best.

[39] DOCTOR: okay so there is a smoker at home you know that does that does affect you so we might have to have a conversation with your brother and anybody else but it's good to know that people are n't sick i do see here though that you have kind of a a history of recurrent strep like you you seem to be having these sore throats a lot i think it says that you've had four in the last five months is that correct
[40] PATIENT: yeah strep and bfs i'm not quite sure what it is just seems to come on you know i get this sore throat and fibroid i'm told i have strep
[41] DOCTOR: okay
[42] PATIENT: sometimes you know my doctor knows what he is doing strep everyday strep everyday but anyway if he says i have strep then i have strep
[43] DOCTOR: i okay i respect that and i'm glad that you you listen to him at the end of the day that's always a good thing alright so now that we've gotten like kind of a lot of the history out of the way i do want to do my physical exam is that okay
[44] PATIENT: sure
[45] DOCTOR: alright so when i look in your throat like i'm not noticing any erythema no swelling your tonsils are midline so those look good when i'm feeling here on your neck i'm not appreciating any like lymphadenopathy no cervical adenopathy and like i wan na check those things because i just wan na make sure i'm not seeing any physical signs of like any kind of strep right now right i do n't want i wan na make sure you're not having an infection when i listen to your lungs i do n't appreciate any wheezes rales rhonchi that means i'm not hearing funky sounds your heart sounds great no murmur no rub no gallop when i press on your back remember you told me you had that left back pain when i press on it does it hurt
[46] PATIENT: no
[47] DOCTOR: okay alright great no tenderness on palpation when i press on your abdomen are you feeling any pain
[48] PATIENT: no
[49] DOCTOR: alright no rebound no guarding that's great okay so based on my physical exam we are gon na have a couple conversations one that ct that your your primary care doctor the the one that you you question his judgment it is showing a couple things that we are a little concerned about it could be that these recurrent strep episodes that you've been having it looks like they are like potentially that they are caused something called glomerular nephritis right there's just some some swelling here and we have to be careful of something like that because it could lead to like kidney disease chronic kidney disease and we wan na make sure that we cut that off right so the first thing is i'm gon na refer you for your problem of glomerulonephritis i'm gon na refer you to an ent i want them to look at you and maybe consider taking out your tonsils to see if that could help with some of the recurrent strep though that you're feeling but i would like to leave that to them to make that decision for you and me we're gon na do some more like confirmations right i'm gon na order some labs i want several a lipid panel a ua a cmp a cbc a vitamin d and a tsh all of these things will give me more information about kind of like what's happening in your body right now in terms of like your hormones and you know your iron levels and to make sure that you are like getting all the nutrition that you need and that your body is operating appropriately i know that that was a lot of words but let me know what questions do you have about your care and your treatment
[50] PATIENT: how much are all these tests going to cost
[51] DOCTOR: they are going to be free ninety nine because your mom is paying for them
[52] PATIENT: okay that's that's good to know
[53] DOCTOR: yes
[54] PATIENT: and when do i when do i have to do those tests
[55] DOCTOR: i would prefer you to get them done as soon as possible so when you walk out of this room there is a a blood lab right next door i need you to go ahead and do some of those draws some of them i will need you to not have eaten we are gon na do them it's called fasting and you can make sure that you have n't eaten when you do but they will the lab techs will know so you will be able to knock out most of those today
[56] PATIENT: okay and i'm not sure i will be able to do that today because i have a class right after this
[57] DOCTOR: mm-hmm
[58] PATIENT: and right after that i have to go to work
[59] DOCTOR: mm-hmm
[60] PATIENT: you know if i told you i'm about changing jobs did i
[61] DOCTOR: no you did n't mention that but one of the cool things about being a doctor is i can write you a note so you're gon na do it and then you can go to the class and we could figure it but like it's really cool that you're changing jobs i'm happy for you i hope you know that like it's always great to be able to make some income and make some decisions that means that you'll be able to start paying for your test soon uh
[62] PATIENT: well yeah this new job there is no insurance and my old boss sucks so i'm hoping i'll get a new boss and you know hopefully some free food with with this ut because it's had a restaurant so we'll we'll see how that goes
[63] DOCTOR: we might have to have a conversation about the free food at the restaurant if we do n't get some of these infections under control because your salt intake is about to be very important okay
[64] PATIENT: got it
[65] DOCTOR: alright okay so do you have any more questions before i send my nurse in

[20] PATIENT: you know it it's my back that's weak and my legs are weak both of them you know coughing sneezing seem to make it worse so sorry i'm just trying to be like a typical patient because most patients they do n't answer the darn questions so you you know all this time i still have n't gotten a chief complaint out of them so i love the way that you're trying to redirect and so you know what your doctor said you had back pain and leg pain but for me the most important thing for me to capture is that it's in the hip side of the leg side of the calf goes to the big toe and so i need them to be able to give me a perfect sort of root signature so i can hone in is that four five disk seen on the mri really significant or is it on the opposite side but again i'm sorry i'm purposely trying to be in a difficult patient because some of these patients he asked them fifty different questions they wo n't answer any of them so anyway sorry about well
[21] DOCTOR: that's okay
[22] PATIENT: to explain but this is what i deal with every single day
[23] DOCTOR: absolutely
[24] PATIENT: lot of pain yeah you know what my pain is eight out of ten it goes in the back goes into the hip side of the leg side of the calf goes to the big toe my foot kinda drags when i walk i've been having to use a cane nothing seems to make it better and but very few patients will give you the perfect history and most people will start talking about you know when something happened or go back to thirty years ago and you wan na redirect them to their current symptom but the patients wo n't rarely ever tell you what the chief complaint is you you got ta pull it out of them
[25] DOCTOR: so let's take a a quick look at you here okay let's do a physical exam real quick so your vitals look good which is a good thing now on your back exam i do n't see any bony abnormalities no redness or no and no bruising present now do you have pain when i press here
[26] PATIENT: no it's right here
[27] DOCTOR: okay so positive for pain to palpation at the l4 vertebrae and if you bend forward do you have pain there
[28] PATIENT: it hurts all the time especially sitting in these run office desks
[29] DOCTOR: okay so you are positive for pain with flexion and extension of your back i'm going to go ahead and test the strength of your legs now push out against my hands for me please
[30] PATIENT: okay that's it that's all i got
[31] DOCTOR: alright so four out of five strength in the left and five out of five on the right does look like that reflexes are brisk and motor and sensory is intact in both lower extremities i do wan na review the results of your mri the mri shows a disk herniation at the level of l4 l5 vertebrae and it is associated with some nerve root impingement and what that means is the nerve is being compressed by that herniation so let me tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan okay so for the diagnosis of of acute disk herniation at l4 l5 with that nerve root impingement that's causing that pain down your leg and your lower back pain now i know you've tried nsaids in the past without relief and you've done some pt so what i'm going to do is i'm gon na recommend an epidural steroid injection and we're gon na do that today for you if you agree to it what that means is gon na place some anti-inflammatory medication right at the spot of inflammation and once that's in place i wan na refer you back to pt and we wan na strengthen that area mkay you're young and otherwise healthy i think you'll do well but it can take about two to three weeks for that injection really to take full effect so then i want you to see pt and i want you to see me again in about a month are you okay with that treatment plan
[32] PATIENT: sure sounds good
[33] DOCTOR: alright sounds good i'm gon na have the nurse come in and get you prepped and then we'll get that injection for youassistant

[104] DOCTOR: And have you been doing anything yourself to help with the symptoms?
[105] DOCTOR: Anything that you've bought in the chemist?
[106] PATIENT: Um, uh, a quite a few lemon sips.
[107] PATIENT: Um, they seems to be helping.
[108] DOCTOR: Do you, what, what do you mean by quite a few?
[109] DOCTOR: How many in, in a day do you normally take?
[110] PATIENT: Uh, maybe two or three.
[111] PATIENT: Maybe, like, at the start of the day and at the end of the day.
[112] DOCTOR: OK. Have you noticed any improvement in that?

[114] PATIENT: It tends to soothe my throat a bit for when I'm going to sleep.

[116] PATIENT: Uh, I sometimes suffer from some, like, hay fever.
[117] PATIENT: But, um, but it's not bad
[118] DOCTOR: Any .
[119] DOCTOR: Any allergies to any medications at all?
[120] PATIENT: Not that I'm aware of, no.
[121] DOCTOR: OK.
[122] DOCTOR: So, what you've described to me, it sounds like you, you probably have got an infection in the chest, um, because it's, it, you know, you're obviously getting symptoms of from your nose and your chest.
[123] DOCTOR: Um, it sounds like you might have a high temperature, it's definitely worth getting a thermometer and checking your temperature.
[124] PATIENT: OK.
[125] PATIENT: I can just get one of those at a pharmacy or something?
[126] DOCTOR: Yeah, and most of the time, these infections are caused by viruses, so they do normally settle by themselves.
[127] DOCTOR: But it can take, you know, a week or two, um, and you can persistently have the cough ongoing longer than that.
[128] DOCTOR: Um, the important thing to do would be to take your temperature.
[129] DOCTOR: Um, and if you feel like, if the temperature's ongoing, above thirty seven point five, thirty eight, um, and you keep spiking temperatures and that's not settling down, or your cough's getting worse, you're coughing up lots of nasty phlegm or you cough up any blood or get blood coming out your nose,
[130] DOCTOR: um, or any shortness of breath, chest pain, then we certainly would need to speak to you again.
[131] DOCTOR: With the diabetes you are a bit more likely to get a bacterial infection than if you didn't have the diabetes, so it's something we do need to be careful of.
[132] PATIENT: OK.
[133] PATIENT: OK.
[134] PATIENT: So, then we would at potentially antibiotics at that time, perhaps?
[135] DOCTOR: Yeah, potentially.
[136] DOCTOR: If it is, if it's not settling or the temperature's ongoing, getting worse, then we definitely need to talk to you again.
[137] PATIENT: OK.
[138] DOCTOR: Um, have you got any other questions?
[139] PATIENT: Um, no, that's all fine.
[140] DOCTOR: It's fine to carry on what you're doing at the moment, with the lemsip.
[141] DOCTOR: I wouldn't take, and that, that contains paracetamol so don't take any other paracetamol containing products, um, with that at the same time.
[142] PATIENT: Yeah.
[143] DOCTOR: Um, the cough syrup isn't advisable in the daytime because it's best for your body if you just keep coughing.
[144] DOCTOR: But if you're kept up all night and you can't sleep at all, then it, it's OK to have a little bit of cough syrup, just to settle that down.
[145] PATIENT: OK.
[146] PATIENT: Cool.
[147] DOCTOR: OK?
[148] DOCTOR: Do you have blood sugar checking equipment?
[149] DOCTOR: Do you check?
[150] DOCTOR: No, OK. Well, if you make sure that you have the regular diabetes and blood pressure checkups that your GP has asked you for?
[151] PATIENT: Yep.
[152] PATIENT: I'm not at home.
[153] PATIENT: Yeah.
[154] DOCTOR: OK, great.
[155] DOCTOR: Alright then, take care.
[156] DOCTOR: Bye.

[40] PATIENT: okay and do you have a podiatrist for your yearly foot exams
[41] DOCTOR: no i i i do n't okay alright alright well let's go ahead i wan na just do a quick physical exam i'm just gon na be calling out some of my exam findings so your vital signs here in the office you do n't have any fever so that's good your blood pressure is great it's like one twenty seven over eighty and your heart rate is nice and slow in the sixties on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any jugular venous distention or any carotid bruits on your lung exam your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally on your heart exam you do have a two out of six systolic ejection murmur heard at the left base and on your lower extremity exam i do n't appreciate any palpable dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial pulses there is a two by three centimeter ulcerated lesion on the right lateral foot near the fifth metacarpal metatarsophalangeal joint there is no associated cellulitis does it hurt when i press here
[42] PATIENT: no
[43] DOCTOR: there is no pain to palpation of the right foot there is associated granulation tissue and some slight purulent discharge from the wound okay so what does all that mean that just means that you have this ulcer that's you know fairly sizable with i think we need to do some good wound care on it let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan so you know i you have a nonhealing ulcer of your right foot so we need to do some studies on you to see if you have an adequate blood supply to heal this foot wound and since you since you probably do n't because of your diabetes you're here in a vascular surgeon's office we may have to go ahead and talk about being able to open up some of your arteries to improve the blood supply to your foot so that might mean getting a stent to one of your arteries in your legs to open up the blood supply it might mean mean that we might have to do some bypass surgery to to improve the blood supply to your foot in order to heal that that wound i do think that you'll be able to heal it i do n't think that we need to do anything drastic i want you to continue with your aspirin because that will help

[4] DOCTOR: hello , how are you ?
[5] PATIENT: i'm good , thank you .
[6] DOCTOR: so tell me what brings you in today .
[7] PATIENT: recently i tried to donate blood , around december i think , and they told me i was anemic , which is something i've been dealing with for a while , so it's not the first time i've been told i'm anemic .

[14] DOCTOR: are there any other symptoms ?
[15] PATIENT: i've been noting some chilling sensations .
[16] PATIENT: i also get cold so easily .
[17] PATIENT: it's annoying .
[18] PATIENT: i feel like i have to really bundle up .
[19] PATIENT: i do n't know if this is related but my anxiety and depression feel like it has been getting worse lately .
[20] PATIENT: i feel like a mess .
[21] DOCTOR: sounds like you're not feeling great , obviously .
[22] DOCTOR: and i'm glad you came to see us .
[23] DOCTOR: um , we're certainly going to try to figure this out and figure out what's going on , uh , but it sounds like you've been dealing with this anemia for a long time ?
[24] PATIENT: yeah , i've been anemic since i was 13 years old .
[25] DOCTOR: right .
[26] DOCTOR: so why do your doctors think you're anemic ?
[27] DOCTOR: do you have a history of heavy periods ?
[28] PATIENT: well i did have heavy periods until i had a hysterectomy in 1996 .
[29] PATIENT: but no , they have not told me why they think i'm anemic , which is frustrating honestly .
[30] DOCTOR: yeah .
[31] DOCTOR: i can imagine that is .
[32] DOCTOR: um , let's see if we can help though .
[33] DOCTOR: since you had your hysterectomy your periods , of course , are no longer the issue .
[34] DOCTOR: um , when was your last colonoscopy ?
[35] PATIENT: about five to six years ago .
[36] DOCTOR: and was it relatively a normal exam ?
[37] DOCTOR: did you have any polyps ?
[38] PATIENT: no .
[39] PATIENT: they said they'd see me in 10 years .
[40] DOCTOR: well that's good news .
[41] PATIENT: yeah , i agree .
[42] DOCTOR: um , do you have a pacemaker or defibrillator , or have sleep apnea , or use oxygen at night ?
[43] PATIENT: no .
[44] DOCTOR: all right .
[45] DOCTOR: do you ever drink alcohol ?
[46] PATIENT: yeah , but only once or twice a year .
[47] DOCTOR: okay .
[48] DOCTOR: are you taking any supplements such as iron or vitamin b12 ?
[49] PATIENT: i already started taking my iron pills which i have not taken in about a year .
[50] DOCTOR: all right .
[51] DOCTOR: and what are you taking ?
[52] PATIENT: i'm taking 25 milligram tablets , twice daily .
[53] DOCTOR: okay , and that's the , the ferrous sulfate ?
[54] PATIENT: yeah , that's it .
[55] PATIENT: i take one in the morning and one in the evening .
[56] DOCTOR: okay .
[57] DOCTOR: anything else ?
[58] PATIENT: yeah , i take vitamin b12 , just the over the counter stuff .
[59] DOCTOR: okay , very good .
[60] DOCTOR: all right , well let's go ahead and take a look and see what's going on .
[61] PATIENT: sounds good .
[62] PATIENT: thank you .
[63] DOCTOR: of course .
[64] DOCTOR: you'll hear me , uh , talk through your exam so that i get all the information documented .
[65] PATIENT: okay .
[66] DOCTOR: all right .
[67] DOCTOR: so use my general physical exam template .
[68] DOCTOR: i will start by listening to your heart and lungs .
[69] PATIENT: okay .
[70] DOCTOR: all right .
[71] DOCTOR: next , i'd like you to lay back so i can examine your abdomen .
[72] PATIENT: okay .
[73] DOCTOR: is there any tenderness where i'm pressing ?
[74] PATIENT: no .
[75] DOCTOR: okay .
[76] DOCTOR: you can sit up .
[77] DOCTOR: so your physical exam is normal without any significant findings .
[78] DOCTOR: all right ms. cooper , often when we initially see anemia and your host of symptoms , we suspect internal bleeding .
[79] PATIENT: is that why they want me to have another upper endoscopy ?
[80] DOCTOR: actually it would be an upper endoscopy and a colonoscopy , but yes , likely that's the reason why .
[81] PATIENT: lovely .
[82] DOCTOR: yeah .
[83] DOCTOR: unfortunately our cameras do not meet all the way in the middle , so if those tests back , come , if those tests come back fine , then we'll have you swallow a pill camera to take pictures as it moves through your , uh , system .
[84] PATIENT: okay .
[85] DOCTOR: we may not need to , but it's just the first thing we can do to make sure that you're not losing blood .
[86] DOCTOR: um , the second thing we can do is have you see a hematologist .
[87] DOCTOR: they will tell us if you need to give any , to give you any intravenous iron , or maybe something to help your body store the iron better .
[88] PATIENT: all right .
[89] DOCTOR: so let's go ahead , get your upper endoscopy and colonoscopy scheduled .
[90] PATIENT: okay .
[91] DOCTOR: um , have you ever had any issue with sedation in the past ?
[92] PATIENT: no , i was just sleepy afterwards .
[93] DOCTOR: okay .
[94] DOCTOR: well we will give you a bowel prep to clean out your bowels ahead of time .
[95] DOCTOR: um , if we do these tests and they are normal , like i said , then we will consider that capsule endoscopy .
[96] PATIENT: okay .
[97] PATIENT: sounds like a plan .
[98] DOCTOR: all right .
[99] DOCTOR: so after that you'll be all done and we will send you to the hematologist .
[100] DOCTOR: additionally , i'm going to need you to start taking your iron pills with orange juice .
[101] DOCTOR: uh , the vitamin c will help you absorb the iron better .
[102] DOCTOR: do this for about 8-12 weeks , uh , and then we can reassess your blood work .
[103] PATIENT: okay , that sounds great .
[104] DOCTOR: all right .
[105] DOCTOR: well i think we have our plan .
[106] DOCTOR: on your way out , stop by and schedule your upper endoscopy and c- colonoscopy .
[107] DOCTOR: uh , we will send a referral to dr. flores who is is the hematologist , so schedule that appointment .
[108] DOCTOR: um , here are your instructions for the pre- uh , the bowel prep .
[109] DOCTOR: uh , call us if you have any questions or worsening symptoms .
[110] DOCTOR: we'll be happy to help you .
[111] PATIENT: thank you .
[112] DOCTOR: you're welcome .
[113] DOCTOR: have a great day , have a great day ms. cooper .
[114] PATIENT: you too .
[115] DOCTOR: all right .

[117] DOCTOR: um , her followup blood work on 01/20/20 was revealed a low hemoglobin , stable hematocrit and normal iron labs , although ferritin was low .
[118] DOCTOR: um , she was taking ferrous sulfate , three hundred , twenty phil- 25 milligrams by mouth .

[120] DOCTOR: um , a referral was sent to her hematologist .

[70] PATIENT: Whatever, that'd be really useful.

[79] PATIENT: Um, actually I'm, just uh, not, not really waking up early.

[41] PATIENT: on the way , it is now i think about a year .
[42] DOCTOR: okay .

[44] PATIENT: i mean , i can tell it's helped because some days , i'll be fine , and then some days , i eat something and it feels terrible .
[45] DOCTOR: are there any things that make your symptoms worse that you can pinpoint , like food choices or stress ?
[46] PATIENT: sure .
[47] PATIENT: probably stress and food choices sometimes .
[48] DOCTOR: okay .
[49] DOCTOR: what things bother you ?
[50] PATIENT: spicy foods , um , so i try not to eat them too often , but sometimes even drinking a soda can cause it .
[51] DOCTOR: we do know that caffeine and caffeinated beverages will do that , even sodas .
[52] DOCTOR: um , even just the carbonation can cause that .
[53] DOCTOR: how about tomato-based products or citrus products ?
[54] PATIENT: yeah , sometimes , but i still eat them .
[55] DOCTOR: okay .
[56] DOCTOR: it's reassuring that you are n't having any difficulty swallowing , though .

[65] PATIENT: um , my grandmother had esophageal cancer .
[66] DOCTOR: on your mom or dad's side ?
[67] PATIENT: mom's side .
[68] PATIENT: and my mom had some issues like acid reflux , and she was taking some medication that coats the lining of your stomach .
[69] DOCTOR: okay .
[70] DOCTOR: have you ever had an upper endoscopy ?
[71] PATIENT: i think maybe when i was younger .
[72] DOCTOR: but not in the last 10 years ?
[73] PATIENT: no .
[74] DOCTOR: have you ever tried any medication other than omeprazole ?
[75] PATIENT: um , at one point i was on omeprazole and ranititine -dine .
[76] PATIENT: it did help .
[77] PATIENT: but other than that , those are the only medications i have taken .
[78] DOCTOR: okay .
[79] DOCTOR: have a seat here , and let me listen to your heart and lungs , and then we can talk about a plan for you .
[80] PATIENT: okay .
[81] DOCTOR: so normal physical exam per my new patient template , except for well-healed abdominal surgical scars noted .
[82] DOCTOR: what's the surgical scar here on your abdomen from ?
[83] PATIENT: i always forget about that surgery .
[84] PATIENT: i had it when i was a baby .
[85] PATIENT: my mom said my intestines were twisted , so i had to have surgery when i was around one month old .
[86] DOCTOR: hm , gotcha .
[87] DOCTOR: okay .
[88] DOCTOR: so let's talk about what you have going on .
[89] DOCTOR: from what you've told me , it sounds like you've had a several-year history of gerd , which is the medical term for acid reflux .
[90] DOCTOR: and recently your symptoms have been poorly controlled with the omeprazole , 40 milligrams twice daily .
[91] DOCTOR: you've been having heartburn despite taking this medication , correct ?
[92] PATIENT: yes .
[93] DOCTOR: and you've identified trigger foods like spicy foods , carbonated bev- beverages , citrus , and tomato-based foods , but you have n't cut these foods out of your diet completely yet .
[94] DOCTOR: so the first thing i'd try is changing your diet because these foods can exacerbate your gerd , even though you're taking the ppi .
[95] PATIENT: okay , yeah , i could definitely do a better job of avoiding those foods .
[96] DOCTOR: great .
[97] DOCTOR: so stress is another trigger that we need to address .
[98] DOCTOR: high stress can cause worsening of your symptoms .
[99] PATIENT: yeah , stress and anxiety are definitely big problems for me .
[100] DOCTOR: so working on that may help with your gerd .
[101] DOCTOR: additionally , we can consider trying a different ppi since the only one you've tried up to this point is omeprazole .
[102] DOCTOR: if you're okay with this , we can switch your omeprazole to nexium .
[103] PATIENT: that's fine with me .
[104] PATIENT: i'm definitely open to trying whatever .
[105] DOCTOR: perfect .
[106] DOCTOR: i will send a prescription for nexium 40 milligrams twice daily to your pharmacy on file .
[107] DOCTOR: i'll also recommend that you have a procedure called a egd , or upper endoscopy , to look for potential causes of the gerd .
[108] DOCTOR: we'd sedate you and then pass a small camera through your mouth , down your throat , through your stomach , and end in the small intestines .
[109] DOCTOR: we'd look for any ulcers or signs of precancerous or cancerous conditions that we can take biopsies at the same time if we see anything .
[110] PATIENT: okay .
[111] PATIENT: can i schedule that today ?
[112] DOCTOR: yeah .
[113] DOCTOR: you can get scheduled at checkout desk .
[114] DOCTOR: i'll have you follow up with me in the office for the egd so we can discuss the results and talk about how you're doing with the dietary , stress , and medication changes .
[115] DOCTOR: how does all of that sound ?
[116] PATIENT: that sounds good .
[117] DOCTOR: perfect .
[118] DOCTOR: i will walk you to the checkout desk .
[119] DOCTOR: be sure to call my office and let me know if anything changes or if you have problems before your egd and follow-up appointment .
[120] DOCTOR: please insert the procedure paragraph in the plan .
[121] DOCTOR: i suspect that she likely has gerd with underlying functional etiology as well .
[122] DOCTOR: reassuringly , she has no unintentional weight loss and denies any dysphagia .
[123] DOCTOR: if her egd is normal and her symptoms pers- persist despite a trial of nexium , we can consider a trial of protonix and obtain a ph-impedance study .
[124] DOCTOR: this will allow us to rule out abnormal acid reflux exposure and to decipher between a functional etiology and hypersensitivity .assistant

[6] PATIENT: okay can you tell me a little bit about them what how do they how do they feel when they come on
[7] DOCTOR: so they say mostly on my right side and it even seems like it's like behind my eye and it just like this pulsing like this really bad pulsing sensation
[8] PATIENT: okay do you notice these any activities or time of the day that makes them worse i know you said they they seem to get worse around your menstrual periods but is there any time of the day or that makes them worse
[9] DOCTOR: i i have noticed that you know i've been trying to exercise more in order to lose weight but i ca n't even really exercise for very long because i start of as soon as i start to jog i my headaches the headaches come back on a lot worse so i notice it when i'm exercising
[10] PATIENT: okay and do you seem to have any other symptoms when you get these headaches i've been having a ringing in my ears for a few months now and then what really scared me is that now i'm starting to get some blurred vision it's not all the time but it it will come and go but some blurred like on the
[11] DOCTOR: in my on the side of my vision
[12] PATIENT: okay okay and have you experienced any numbness or tingling to your hands or feet or your face
[13] DOCTOR: no i have n't
[14] PATIENT: okay so you you like to run a lot what kind of do you do you use a a good shoe you know what kind of shoes do you use for your running

[18] PATIENT: i used to get tumor guy but i i really kinda moved over to nike
[19] DOCTOR: hmmm
[20] PATIENT: that's good you know it is running is a great exercise
[21] DOCTOR: it is
[22] PATIENT: so have you had any let's get back to the exam here have you had a recent mri of your brain i saw one from a few years ago but as doctor white said anything about getting a more a recent mri
[23] DOCTOR: yeah she was gon na put one in but she wanted me to see you first and urgently so they have n't called me yet for the mri
[24] PATIENT: okay so that's good we i think we'll we will follow up with that mri but let's go ahead and take a do a quick physical exam here i reviewed your vitals that the the assistant collected when you came in and everything there looks good including your blood pressure you know with symptoms like that that's one of those things that i'd be concerned about
[25] DOCTOR: okay
[26] PATIENT: now on your heart exam it sounds like it's normal sinus rhythm with no murmurs rubs or gallops so that's good as i listen i'm gon na go ahead and look here in your eyes the funduscopic exam shows papilledema and that's just some of swelling behind there in the eye and this let me do a a neurological exam this will take a few minutes you get up to follow my instructions as we go through that okay on neurological exam your cranial nerves one through twelve are intact including a normal cranial reflex and just went to watch you walk across the room here
[27] DOCTOR: okay turn around come back and okay so on musculoskeletal exam your gait is normal
[28] DOCTOR: okay go ahead sorry
[29] PATIENT: that's okay for your first problem your headaches your symptoms are concerning for what we call idiopathic intracranial hypertension and this is a condition that that you have increased pressure in the in your head in your brain without any known cause for it now patient also presents with often present with symptoms such as yours you know headaches worsening with activity ringing in the ears changes in your vision so i'm i'm pretty confident that that's what we're having here now why we get concerned is if the pressure continues to increase this can lead to some permanent changes in your vision so i i do wan na get a a few more tests just so we can confirm that diagnosis and the first one that we just talked about is an mri i think it's really important to get that to check for any other condition that could be contributing to your symptoms now once i have that result i'm gon na be doing also doing a spinal tap which will help me evaluate the pressure in the brain and it can also help you feel better if you do have an increased pressure by taking the decreasing the amount of that pressure just by taking a a a little bit of fluid off of that and lastly i want you to be seen by a neuro-ophthalmologist for a complete eye exam now i i know that sounds like a lot of information but i think it's really important we get that accomplished do you have any questions for me
[30] DOCTOR: yeah that is a lot and so i i'm sure i'll have more that comes up but so let's say we do all this test and it confirms what you're saying does that mean was i referred to you because that means i will need surgery
[31] PATIENT: not necessarily if you have idiopathic intracranial hypertension there are number of medications that we can try to help decrease that pressure in your brain and this will also help you have less headaches when you exercise as exercise and weight loss are also an important part of the treatment
[32] DOCTOR: okay alright alright and i'll probably add something about so is this something i'll be doing soon is this all things i'll be doing this week
[33] PATIENT: yeah that's a great question here i i'm gon na go ahead and we're gon na for the mri i'll have to get a preapproval from your insurance company i will work on that my my my team in the front office will get that preapproved and then once that's done we'll call you to help schedule that mri

[27] DOCTOR: okay if it's okay with you i'm gon na do a quick physical exam your vital signs look good today blood pressure of one twenty four over seventy six heart rate of seventy respiration rate of sixteen o2 sat on room air of ninety eight percent and you are afebrile so you do n't have a fever today i'm gon na take a quick listen to your lungs here your lungs are clear and equal bilateral when i listen to them or when i auscultate your lungs now listening to your heart regular rate and rhythm no clicks rubs or murmurs and i do n't appreciate any extra beats doing a quick extremity exam your skin is pink warm and dry i do n't appreciate any edema to your lower extremities it looks like you do have a little bit of swelling to to your knuckles there on your third digit on each hand which can be normal for somebody who has ra however pulses are intact in all extremities and capillary refill is brisk so a quick review of your results now you had a chest ct before you came in to see me and the results of that chest ct do show a solitary two centimeter nodule in the lateral aspect of the right upper lobe now it appears the nodule is smooth in appearance and no evidence of any type of emphysematous disease is present which is good now for my assessment and plan for you so you do have an incidentally found right upper lobe lung nodule i'm going to order some pft which is pulmonary function test i just wan na get a check and and a baseline for your lung function i'm also going to schedule a pet ct this is gon na help to determine if that nodule is metabolically active meaning if it lights up it it can suggest that it's cancer or inflammatory i'm going to go ahead and suggest that we do remove this during or via video assisted thoracoscopy which means it's just gon na be three small incisions made on the side of your right chest i'm gon na go in with a camera and a scope and we'll remove that along with a very small portion of your lung you're gon na be under general anesthesia and it'll take about an hour and a half or so post procedure you're gon na be admitted and you will have a chest tube in until the following day and i'm gon na go ahead and take that out then at bedside most likely you're gon na be in the hospital for one night and go home the next day it could be a benign nodule but because your smoking history i really do think it's gon na be best that you have that removed now for your secondary concern of your rheumatoid arthritis i want you to continue to follow up with your rheumatologist and continue your medication therapy as has been previously outlined for you now do you have any questions comments or concerns before before we get the paperwork signed to start the the treatment process

[123] DOCTOR: In the interim, what I'd like you to do is you can use your blue inhaler as and when.
[124] DOCTOR: OK. You can use it maximum about every two to four, four hours, but if you're using it that often that means pretty much that, you know, your asthma is really bad.

[141] DOCTOR: Make you do the peak flow reading.
[142] DOCTOR: So depending on what we find, you might need some antibiotics and some steroids.

[25] DOCTOR: okay we checked your hemoglobin a1c last time i'm looking at your records in epic and it showed that it was you know seven .
[26] DOCTOR: one so it's it's it's good but it could be better any you know we talked about it controlling your diet or improving your diet and trying to have a balanced meal and not eating some of these sweets and high sugar items how is that going i know you had talked about your wife being a great cook and making cookies and that's hard to stay away from obviously how are things going with that
[27] PATIENT: yeah she still makes cookies and i still eat them but you know we are trying to trying to do better trying to stay away from more of those carbs and focus on you know less carby less sweet stuff
[28] DOCTOR: okay alright yeah that's always a struggle i certainly understand but you know really important with your diabetes just to prevent some of the complications like kidney failure and eye problems and just keep your sugar under balance so i'll order another hemoglobin a1c today we'll check that again today and and you know just reemphasizing the controlling your diet and exercise is super important and then we'll have those results back we'll we'll see if we need to make any modifications okay

[33] PATIENT: i have n't had any real problems there i i have had some some swelling in my ankles though

[36] DOCTOR: okay
[37] PATIENT: and i was just wondering if the two might be related
[38] DOCTOR: yeah i mean certainly it could be it is you know sometimes that medication can cause that so i'll i'll examine you in a second and see if we need to make any modifications okay
[39] PATIENT: okay
[40] DOCTOR: alright so and your anything else bothering you today
[41] PATIENT: no i'm we're doing okay i think
[42] DOCTOR: so let me examine you for a second i'm gon na go ahead and gabriel i'm gon na do my magic exam now let's pretend i i'm just gon na verbalize some of my findings as i do my exam and so
[43] PATIENT: these are like my video visit exams
[44] DOCTOR: exactly so your neck exam has no jvd there is no bruits that i can hear your lung exam no rales no wheezing on your heart exam you do have a two over six systolic ejection murmur you had that in the past so i'm not too worried about that otherwise regular rate and rhythm on your heart exam on your on your on your belly exam is nice and soft on your back exam you do have some tenderness on the left paraspinal area right where i'm pressing right there your straight leg raise test is negative your reflexes are normal you have some just some tenderness in the lower back in the paraspinal area of your back when i palpate there otherwise your neurological exam is normal on your extremity exam you do have this one plus nonpitting edema of your lower extremities which is a little bit of swelling in your ankles no calf tenderness negative homans sign no signs of blood clot that's what that means so let me just review what you know explain what all this means so the back pain the first problem that you're here today for i think this is more of a muscular sprain i'm gon na recommend we start you on some anti-inflammatory naprosyn five hundred five hundred milligrams twice a day and flexeril ten milligrams twice a day as well i'm gon na refer you to for for physical therapy to help strengthen some of the muscles in your lower back i do n't think you need an x-ray at this stage why do n't we start with physical therapy and the muscle relaxers and the pain medicines if it does n't get better then we can get an x-ray but right now i would start with that if that's okay with you any questions about that
[45] PATIENT: no
[46] DOCTOR: okay for the diabetes the the second problem that we talked about today i'm gon na order another hemoglobin a1c continue the metformin five hundred milligrams twice a day why do n't we have you come back in about two weeks and we should have some of the results back and we can discuss if we need to make any modifications for that but right now we will continue the course and we will go from there okay for the high blood pressure you do have this one plus edema in your legs i'm gon na go ahead and order some blood work today i'm gon na go ahead and stop the norvasc and we'll put you on some hydrochlorothiazide ten milligrams once a day and if that does n't get if the swelling does n't go away i'm gon na do some more testing for right now let's get some sort off with some cbc and a bmp i'm gon na check your kidney function i'm gon na get another ekg and also i'm gon na get a chest x-ray and we'll go from there but hopefully this will go away once we stop this medication since it started around that time okay okay and i think that's it anything else we forgot about do you need refills for anything

[25] DOCTOR: okay alright and then things like lung infections or pneumonia do you have any previous history of that
[26] PATIENT: no no not not anything that i'm aware of
[27] DOCTOR: okay if it's okay with you i'm gon na do a quick physical exam your vital signs look good today blood pressure of one twenty four over seventy six heart rate of seventy respiration rate of sixteen o2 sat on room air of ninety eight percent and you are afebrile so you do n't have a fever today i'm gon na take a quick listen to your lungs here your lungs are clear and equal bilateral when i listen to them or when i auscultate your lungs now listening to your heart regular rate and rhythm no clicks rubs or murmurs and i do n't appreciate any extra beats doing a quick extremity exam your skin is pink warm and dry i do n't appreciate any edema to your lower extremities it looks like you do have a little bit of swelling to to your knuckles there on your third digit on each hand which can be normal for somebody who has ra however pulses are intact in all extremities and capillary refill is brisk so a quick review of your results now you had a chest ct before you came in to see me and the results of that chest ct do show a solitary two centimeter nodule in the lateral aspect of the right upper lobe now it appears the nodule is smooth in appearance and no evidence of any type of emphysematous disease is present which is good now for my assessment and plan for you so you do have an incidentally found right upper lobe lung nodule i'm going to order some pft which is pulmonary function test i just wan na get a check and and a baseline for your lung function i'm also going to schedule a pet ct this is gon na help to determine if that nodule is metabolically active meaning if it lights up it it can suggest that it's cancer or inflammatory i'm going to go ahead and suggest that we do remove this during or via video assisted thoracoscopy which means it's just gon na be three small incisions made on the side of your right chest i'm gon na go in with a camera and a scope and we'll remove that along with a very small portion of your lung you're gon na be under general anesthesia and it'll take about an hour and a half or so post procedure you're gon na be admitted and you will have a chest tube in until the following day and i'm gon na go ahead and take that out then at bedside most likely you're gon na be in the hospital for one night and go home the next day it could be a benign nodule but because your smoking history i really do think it's gon na be best that you have that removed now for your secondary concern of your rheumatoid arthritis i want you to continue to follow up with your rheumatologist and continue your medication therapy as has been previously outlined for you now do you have any questions comments or concerns before before we get the paperwork signed to start the the treatment process

[25] DOCTOR: okay
[26] PATIENT: it's just really along my wrist
[27] DOCTOR: okay any numbness any tingling
[28] PATIENT: a little one and one ca n't tell if it's just because of the swelling in my wrist but just i can like i can feel it my fingers still
[29] DOCTOR: mm-hmm
[30] PATIENT: but just maybe a little bit of tingling
[31] DOCTOR: okay alright and are you so so okay i'm gon na think on this but in the meantime i'm gon na do my physical exam alright
[32] PATIENT: okay
[33] DOCTOR: okay so you know looking at your looking at your head and your neck i do n't appreciate any like adenopathy no thyromegaly no no carotid bruit looking at your listening to your heart i do n't appreciate any murmur no rub no gallop your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally your lower legs you have palpable pulses no lower edema your shoulders every like your upper extremities i see normal range of movement with your right wrist let's go ahead and focus on it so when i push on the inside here does it hurt
[34] PATIENT: yes
[35] DOCTOR: okay
[36] PATIENT: it does
[37] DOCTOR: and what about the outside does that hurt as well
[38] PATIENT: yeah it does
[39] DOCTOR: are you able to move your wrist towards your arm like
[40] PATIENT: not without extreme pain
[41] DOCTOR: okay so pain on flexion what about extension when you pick your wrist up
[42] PATIENT: yeah i have a hard time doing that actually
[43] DOCTOR: alright what about we're gon na go ahead and hold your arm like straight like flat and then try and move it sideways does radial deviation hurt
[44] PATIENT: yeah
[45] DOCTOR: alright and then lateral as well
[46] PATIENT: yeah it's really hard to move any direction of this hand for some reason
[47] DOCTOR: alright so wrist abduction adduction positive for pain on movement are you able to make a fist
[48] PATIENT: hmmm yeah a little bit but i ca n't do it really tight
[49] DOCTOR: okay alright okay so i'm just gon na go ahead and feel on your fingers really quickly alright metacarpals intact noticed some obvious swelling ecchymosis obvious swelling and bruising tenderness on palpation throughout there is evidence of potential fracture feeling some bony crepitus alright so this pain is it like chronic i wanted to ask you
[50] PATIENT: yeah i would say it kinda goes away when i take that ibuprofen but for the most part i feel it i feel it there and it it's just really really bad when i move it all
[51] DOCTOR: okay so when you like is there a position either hurts less or hurts more like say if your arm is raised and elevated over your head does it hurt more or is it just best to keep it like down
[52] PATIENT: it's good if i keep it a little bit above my like a little i guess a little bit like around my like just a regular level like if you're typing or something and then i just put it on a pillow and i just let it stay straight like i feel better
[53] DOCTOR: okay yeah no i do n't think i understand completely okay so i took a look at your vitals and your blood pressure is a little elevated but honestly that's probably to do with the pain right our body can respond to pain in that way we are looking at like a hundred and forty over over seventy it's not anything crazy but something to mention i see that your heart rate is also a little elevated at like about like eighty beats a minute you are not running a fever so that's great look at ninety ninety seven .
[54] DOCTOR: two your respiratory rate is pretty normal at like twenty so before we came in i i know that we had you do an x-ray and i'm sure that that was a bit more painful because we had to do so many manipulations but i do wan na note that you are positive for what we call a colles' fracture what that means is that the joints between your wrist like the bones between your wrist that there there is evidence of a a fracture and we are gon na have to treat it a little conservatively at first and then consider some of the options options that are available to us so for your primary diagnosis of a colles' fracture we are going to give you a thumb spica for today and that's going to
[55] PATIENT: i'm sorry
[56] DOCTOR: pardon what
[57] PATIENT: a what
[58] DOCTOR: we're gon na brace you we're gon na give you a brace
[59] PATIENT: okay thank you
[60] DOCTOR: sorry no problem sorry yeah not a thumb spica we're gon na brace your arm and you're gon na have that we we have a couple of options but i think the best course of action is gon na be for surgery we will in the meantime give you pain medication i wan na put you on fifty milligrams of ultram every six hours and then i also wan na get you on get you into physical therapy a few weeks after surgery this is gon na be just a normal procedure you will be in for an overnight stay but after that once we assess and make sure that everything is good you'll be able to go home okay
[61] PATIENT: when do i have to have the surgery
[62] DOCTOR: we would like it to happen as quickly as possible you know your body is a wonderful miracle and it's going to start trying to heal on it's own what we need to do is get your wrist straight and then like put screws in to make sure that we hold it in place or else it could like heal and malform
[63] PATIENT: okay
[64] DOCTOR: alright so what
[65] PATIENT: how how long do i have to wear that brace
[66] DOCTOR: you're gon na be wearing the brace for about six weeks
[67] PATIENT: six weeks
[68] DOCTOR: yeah so you're gon na you're gon na come in for your surgery we're gon na perform it you're gon na stay overnight and then you'll be bracing it for six weeks in the meantime you'll also then go to physical therapy i want you there like we're gon na they're gon na do an assessment and determine how much but i'm thinking probably three times a week just to make sure that you can get your wrist as strong as possible to prevent like future injury now the cool thing about getting any kind of a bone break is that your your body comes out even stronger so this should n't happen again but unfortunately like it's these situations that oof that just kind of
[69] PATIENT: oof
[70] DOCTOR: these these deform these deformities that really that really kind of hurt is the short version alright no problem any other questions
[71] PATIENT: no well i am going on vacation do i need to cancel it like can i still go even with the i mean after the surgery
[72] DOCTOR: yeah
[73] PATIENT: do it as soon as possible i'm going a vacation in a month so
[74] DOCTOR: okay how long is the vacation
[75] PATIENT: it's only for like a couple weeks
[76] DOCTOR: okay well so you might have to postpone it just because depending on what physical therapy says right if they feel that you can sustain if you can like sustain the exercises while you're gone that if there's something that you can do by yourself then you should be fine but we do wan na give it you said that it's gon na happen in a couple of weeks
[77] PATIENT: no vacation in a month
[78] DOCTOR: okay okay yeah so how about in a month we come you come back let's do a checkup again see where we are at and then we can assess whether or not this is something that i would recommend you do
[79] PATIENT: that sounds good thank you
[80] DOCTOR: no problem bye
[81] PATIENT: bye
[82] DOCTOR: the fracture appears extra-articular and usually proximal to the radial ulnar joint dorsal angulation of the distal fracture fragment is present to a variable degree if dorsal angulation is severe presenting with a dinner fork deformity ulnar styloid fracture is presentassistant

[9] DOCTOR: oh
[10] PATIENT: maybe a different one i wonder if patient has history of
[11] DOCTOR: macular degeneration yeah yeah i was because we do n't we do n't to do the intro anymore i was just going with that you you're coming in with sudden visual distortion and blurring of vision so i'll just you know i'll just say i'll just go ahead and go into this technician part so it looks like the technician noticed that you've been having a decrease in vision when reading and straight lines and your door frames have been looking crooked to you is that right
[12] PATIENT: it is yes
[13] DOCTOR: okay what kind of venture are we gon na go into do you do you have the the script or no it it just talks
[14] PATIENT: but it's it's not presenting like like how you're reading it like how you're talking about it is it kinda what i'm saying because like after that i'm supposed to say yeah whenever i take my husband out to like a nice restaurant i have trouble adjusting to those dim lights but i'm not really getting the question of like so what's causing it or where do you have this happening stuff like that so i'm a little confused
[15] DOCTOR: okay i mean i can just straight out follow the script just so we can kinda get it rolling so so i said so hi so it looks like the technician noticed that you've been having a decrease in vision when reading and straight lines in your door frames have been looking crooked to you
[16] PATIENT: yeah and whenever i take my husband out to a nice restaurant i have trouble adjusting to those dim lights
[17] DOCTOR: uh okay so do you have a favorite restaurant you like to go to
[18] PATIENT: i do mcdonalds is one of my favorite here in arlington
[19] DOCTOR: that sounds good what what do you what's your favorite there
[20] PATIENT: they have a great egg plant parmajon one of my favorite so i just go ahead and go with that
[21] DOCTOR: that sounds really nice very good
[22] PATIENT: it's just
[23] DOCTOR: yeah okay well so it looks like you're still smoking a pack of cigarettes a day
[24] PATIENT: yes i tried to stop smoking every now and then but it's still been hard to totally stop
[25] DOCTOR: okay and how is your blood pressure been doing are you keeping up with your medication
[26] PATIENT: i take my blood pressure when i can remember to do so
[27] DOCTOR: okay yeah it's really important to keep up with your blood pressure check that regularly i'm totally going off script and you know might want to keep a log of that as well and check your blood pressures regularly so okay well let me do a just a quick exam of your eyes if you can take off your glasses and just rest your chin on the chin rest okay so the anterior segment examination reveals posterior chamber intraocular lenses in both eyes right eye the cornea is clear no mvi pciol cup to disc is .
[28] DOCTOR: two fundus examination of the right eye shows the retina to be attached three hundred and sixty degrees without any tears or holes or pe changes in the fovea posterior segment exam shows drusen in the macula thickening of the retina presence of subretinal fluid and exudates accumulation positive for hemorrhage left eye the cornea is clear no mvi cup to disc is .
[29] DOCTOR: three or pe changes in the fovea no hemorrhage or subretinal fluid retina is attached okay so i reviewed the results of your diagnostic tests so for the oct so it shows drusen deposit and the retinal pigment epithelium subretinal fluid accumulation choroidal neovascular membrane can be visualized fluorescein angiography reveals focal areas of leakage in the right eye consistent with neurovascular age related macular degeneration so the diagnostic tests and the eye exam are really indicative of neovascular age related macular degeneration so this is advanced to a stage that usually leads to more severe vision loss and it really happens when those abnormal blood vessels start to grow beneath the retina and they will leak fluid and blood and hints the name wet amd and can create a large blind spot in the center of the visual field and this is really with the most common cause for severe loss of vision so my plan is to give you an injection of lucentes once a month it's injected into the vitreous portion of the eye after it's been numbed and injections are given regularly over a period of time it may slow the rate of vision decline or stop further vision loss but however the disease and loss it may also progress despite treatment do you have any questions
[30] PATIENT: i do not no that sounds great
[31] DOCTOR: okayassistant

[10] PATIENT: i was having severe pain and bleeding
[11] DOCTOR: okay now do you have other symptoms such as weight loss constipation vomiting or issues with urination

[13] DOCTOR: okay yeah that's understandable so do you have any children or have you ever been pregnant
[14] PATIENT: i'm sorry i did n't hear that part
[15] DOCTOR: do you have any children or have you ever been pregnant
[16] PATIENT: no to either one of those

[18] PATIENT: thirteen for my period and twenty eighth for menopause
[19] DOCTOR: okay do you take any oral hormone replacement therapy
[20] PATIENT: no
[21] DOCTOR: okay any history of endometriosis
[22] PATIENT: any history of what
[23] DOCTOR: endometriosis
[24] PATIENT: no
[25] DOCTOR: okay how about any family history of any gynecological cancers
[26] PATIENT: i was adopted
[27] DOCTOR: okay okay so i'm just gon na do a quick exam of your abdomen and then perform a vaginal exam okay
[28] PATIENT: okay
[29] DOCTOR: alright okay so i do feel the mass on the where to go here okay
[30] PATIENT: i did n't know you're gon na play a doctor today
[31] DOCTOR: i did okay okay so i do feel the mass on the left side but everything else looks good and on abdominal exam there is slight tenderness to palpation of the left lower quadrant no rebounding or guarding on vaginal exam there are no external lesions on the labia the vaginal vault is within normal limits the cervix is pink without lesions and on bimanual exam i appreciate a left adnexal mass and there is no masses on the right okay so now i reviewed the results of your abdominal ct which show a three centimeter left ovarian mass with an associated local localized lymph node involvement there is no evidence of gross peritoneal or metastatic disease so lem me tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan so for the first problem so i do think this is most likely ovarian cancer looking at your ct scan it looks like stage three a disease based on the lymph node involvement i want to start by sending off some blood tests like a ca-125 and hcg and afp and ldh these are just tests that help me to determine what type of tumor i'm dealing with and then i want you to undergo genetic counseling and testing to see if you have a genetic predisposition for developing ovarian cancer so this stage of ovarian cancer is treated by performing surgery followed by adjunct chemotherapy so this means we'll start chemotherapy after you've recovered from surgery okay so for the surgery i would perform a hysterectomy remove both ovaries and perform a lymph node dissection to remove the involved and involve lymph nodes as well as any other ones i see and i'll also send a sample of any tissue if there anything that looks suspicious at all and we'll be able to tell exactly what stage this is based on the pathology reports i then recommend chemotherapy with cisplatin and taxol and based on how the surgery goes i may want you to receive intraperitoneal intraperitoneal chemo which is done inserting a small tube into your belly for the chemo to go directly into your peritoneum now i know that was a lot sick in do you have any questions or
[32] PATIENT: am i gon na die
[33] DOCTOR: well that's a good question so based on what i see at this time i will we believe you have a favorable diagnosis prognosis and you're also still young and healthy which makes your prognosis even better and we do need to see a final pathology report to give you a definitive answer though okay
[34] PATIENT: alright alrightassistant

[205] DOCTOR: I'm quite happy to increase your dose of Furosemide.
[206] DOCTOR: Maybe, rather than one tablet a day, we can do two tablets a day, for the first few days.
[207] DOCTOR: Um, and see, and see how you're getting on.
[208] PATIENT: OK.
[209] PATIENT: If you think that'll be better.
[210] DOCTOR: Uh,
[211] DOCTOR: I think, I think, it's, it's, it's definitely worth treating your symptoms.
[212] DOCTOR: But what we should also think about is maybe doing a couple of other tests, like a blood test, and maybe an echocardiogram of your heart, to see how well your heart's pumping.
[213] PATIENT: OK.
[214] DOCTOR: Is that something you've had before?
[215] DOCTOR: Yeah, so um, an , it's a, it's a general scan of your heart.
[216] DOCTOR: You might have had this done before, when you were diagnosed.
[217] DOCTOR: And it's just to get a good
[218] PATIENT: What does that?
[219] PATIENT: Ohh yes, I remember now.
[220] DOCTOR: Sorry?
[221] PATIENT: Uh, yeah, I remember now.
[222] PATIENT: .
[223] DOCTOR: You remember that.
[224] DOCTOR: OK, fine.
[225] DOCTOR: That's something I can organize for you today.
[226] DOCTOR: And, and that might take a week or two weeks for that to be organized.
[227] DOCTOR: But, I think certainly in the meantime, let's, um,
[228] DOCTOR: Let's, let's get a blood test done.
[229] DOCTOR: We can check your um, you know your full blood count, look for signs of anemia.
[230] DOCTOR: We can have a check of your kidney function.
[231] DOCTOR: Um, and we can definitely increase your um, your Furosemide, uh, to you know, one tablet twice a day.
[232] DOCTOR: But I really like, would like you to come back and see me in about a week's time, see how you're getting on.
[233] DOCTOR: That sound reasonable?
[234] PATIENT: I think that sounds like a good plan.
[235] DOCTOR: And of course, in the meantime if you are getting more unwell, feel like you're getting more breathless, or you're having any other symptoms like chest pain, or palpitations or dizziness, then, uh, you know I want you to give me a call sooner than that, and we can have a chat on the phone as well.
[236] PATIENT: OK.
[237] PATIENT: I'll see how I get on.
[238] DOCTOR: OK?
[239] DOCTOR: Do you have any questions for me?
[240] PATIENT: Uh, I think that's all pretty clear.
[241] PATIENT: Thank you very much Doctor.
[242] DOCTOR: Great, and then well I wish you all the best!
[243] DOCTOR: Have a good day.
[244] DOCTOR: OK.
[245] DOCTOR: Thank you.
[246] PATIENT: OK. See you soon.assistant

[11] DOCTOR: okay and then do you remember any trauma did you hit your arm or elbow or any on anything
[12] PATIENT: no nothing i i really was trying to think if there is anything else and i ca n't think of anything
[13] DOCTOR: okay and you've never injured that right elbow before
[14] PATIENT: no
[15] DOCTOR: alright so now let's talk a little bit about your pain and how bad it how bad is that pain on a scale from zero to ten ten being the worst pain you've ever felt in your life
[16] PATIENT: i would say probably a six
[17] DOCTOR: okay and does that pain keep you up at night
[18] PATIENT: it does
[19] DOCTOR: okay and when you have that kind of pain does it keep you from doing other type of activities
[20] PATIENT: yeah i mean i still try to like work through with using my arm but yeah it's it's it's difficult for me sometimes to lift and do things because of that pain
[21] DOCTOR: okay and then and how long has this pain been going on
[22] PATIENT: about four days now
[23] DOCTOR: alright and anything you've done to help relieve or alleviate that pain any anything that that's giving you relief
[24] PATIENT: i've tried ibuprofen that helps a little but not much
[25] DOCTOR: okay so if it's okay with you i would like to do a a quick physical exam your vitals look good and i'm gon na do a focused exam on that right elbow i'm gon na go ahead and and and press here do you do you have any pain when i press here
[26] PATIENT: yes i do
[27] DOCTOR: okay so you are positive for pain to palpation you do note that moderate tenderness of the medial epicondyle now i'm gon na have you turn your wrist as if you're turning a door knob do you have any pain when you do that
[28] PATIENT: not really
[29] DOCTOR: okay now turn your wrist in so do you have any pain when you do that

[32] PATIENT: yes i do
[33] DOCTOR: alright so you are positive for pain with resistance against flexion of that left wrist so i let let's go ahead and review the x-ray that we did of your elbow the good news is i do n't see any fracture or bony abnormality of that right elbow which is good so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so for the problem with elbow pain i do believe that this is consistent with medial epicondylitis which is caused by the overuse and potential damage of those tendons that bend
[34] DOCTOR: that that bend the wrist towards the palm now i want you to rest it i'm gon na order a sling and i want you to wear the sling while you're awake now we're also gon na have you apply ice to the elbow for twenty minutes three times a day and i want you to take ibuprofen that's gon na be six hundred milligrams q.6 h. with food and i want you to take that for a full week now you're not gon na like this part but i want you to hold off for the next couple of weeks on doing any type of pottery work okay alright now what i wan na do is i wan na see you again in a week and i wan na see how you're doing okay

[1] DOCTOR: next patient is christine hernandez , uh , date of birth is january 13th , 1982 .
[2] DOCTOR: hey , miss christine , how are you doing today ?
[3] PATIENT: i'm good , thanks .
[4] PATIENT: how are you ?
[5] DOCTOR: i'm pretty good .
[6] DOCTOR: so it looks like you've completed the covid vaccine , that's great .
[7] PATIENT: yes , i did .
[8] DOCTOR: anything new since your last visit ?
[9] PATIENT: no , i did all the tests that you had recommended me to take .
[10] PATIENT: i have n't been able to take the thyroid medicine , the one that you prescribed , as i'm still taking my old one .
[11] PATIENT: um , the price was a little high on the new one .
[12] DOCTOR: okay , so did ... did you try the coupon that i gave you ?
[13] PATIENT: i did not try the coupon , uh , there was a charge of $ 75 .
[14] DOCTOR: okay , well , next time that ... that coupon should help , and it should only be about $ 3 .
[15] PATIENT: okay , um ... i do n't have it , do you happen to have another one you can give me ?
[16] DOCTOR: yep , right here .
[17] PATIENT: wonderful , thank you so much , and ... and then the gel , they are charging me $ 100 for it .
[18] PATIENT: so , i do n't know if this is because it's a ... it's wal-mart , or if i should try somewhere else , or ... maybe you know how or where i can get it cheaper .
[19] DOCTOR: yeah , let's try something else , um ... sometimes it can be cheaper if we just prescribe you the individual ingredients of a medication , rather than the , the combined medication itself .
[20] PATIENT: that would be great .
[21] DOCTOR: so , that's clindamycin gel and benzoyl peroxide , uh , maybe by doing them separately , they could be a lot cheaper .
[22] DOCTOR: so , that we can do .
[23] DOCTOR: the unithroid , with the discount code , should only be about $ 9 for 90 days .
[24] PATIENT: okay , that would be great .
[25] PATIENT: yeah , they were charging me $ 75 , and i just could n't pay that .
[26] DOCTOR: maybe we'll try different pharmacy , as well .
[27] PATIENT: okay .
[28] PATIENT: so , do you think that my weight gain could have been the birth control that i was taking before that caused it ?
[29] DOCTOR: maybe .
[30] DOCTOR: i do n't really see an endocrine cause for it , at least , so i would need to see the , the hyperandrogynism or high testosterone .
[31] DOCTOR: or , a high dhea , to cause acne , or hair growth , or any of that stuff .
[32] DOCTOR: but , the numbers are n't showing up out of range .
[33] PATIENT: okay .
[34] DOCTOR: i really do n't see any endocrine cause for it , like i said .
[35] DOCTOR: your growth hormone was fine , but we definitely want to and need to treat it .
[36] DOCTOR: um , i do n't know if we talked about maybe a little weight loss study .
[37] PATIENT: you mentioned the weight loss study , and you mentioned that i have some meal plans , um , that you had given me .
[38] PATIENT: i still have those , too .
[39] DOCTOR: have you tried to make any changes in the diet since the last time we spoke ?
[40] PATIENT: i've been trying to get better .
[41] PATIENT: i will start back at the gym in july , because of my contract , i had to put a hold on it until then .
[42] DOCTOR: okay .
[43] PATIENT: so , i do want to start doing that .
[44] PATIENT: i will be a little freer since , um , i'll be on vacation after july 8th .
[45] DOCTOR: okay , good .
[46] PATIENT: and then my cousin was telling me to ask you about cla , because it's supposed to help your metabolism .
[47] PATIENT: is that okay to take ?
[48] DOCTOR: um , i'm not sure .
[49] DOCTOR: what is c , cla ?
[50] PATIENT: i'm not sure what it is , either .
[51] DOCTOR: okay , well , i'm unfamiliar with it , so ...
[52] PATIENT: okay .
[53] PATIENT: i also have a coworker who has a thyroid issue too , and she suggested to try chromium for weight loss .
[54] DOCTOR: so , that likely will not help too much .
[55] DOCTOR: you can try either , if you really want to , but then ... it will not accept you into the weight loss study if you try those two .
[56] PATIENT: okay .
[57] DOCTOR: chromium is just a supplement and it wo n't help that much .
[58] PATIENT: it wo n't , okay , thank you .
[59] DOCTOR: it wo n't hurt ... okay , i should n't say that it wo n't hurt , but , it also wo n't help that much .
[60] DOCTOR: so , it's up to you .
[61] PATIENT: okay .
[62] PATIENT: and so , my cousin also suggested amino acids , and that i might find them in certain foods , i guess , for my workout .
[63] DOCTOR: yeah .
[64] DOCTOR: amino acids are fine , they wo n't , wo n't really help with weight loss either , but it might help , uh , you replenish , and just kind of , feel hydrated .
[65] PATIENT: okay .
[66] PATIENT: are they proteins ?
[67] PATIENT: um , my cousin said she had lost some weight , and has been working out every day , but she does n't work , so ... i do n't know .
[68] DOCTOR: yes , amino acids are what make up the protein , which is in any food you eat , with any protein .
[69] DOCTOR: so , meats , dairy , nuts , any of that sort of thing .
[70] PATIENT: okay , thank you .
[71] PATIENT: got it .
[72] DOCTOR: all right .
[73] DOCTOR: um , are you allergic to any medications ?
[74] PATIENT: no , not that i know of .
[75] DOCTOR: okay .
[76] DOCTOR: is your s- skin pretty sensitive ?
[77] PATIENT: yes .
[78] DOCTOR: all right .
[79] PATIENT: um , yeah , my size , i will start getting rashes , with different products .
[80] DOCTOR: and have you ever tried clindamycin topical , as an antibiotic for your acne ?
[81] PATIENT: no , i've never tried anything for it .
[82] DOCTOR: okay .
[83] DOCTOR: we might give you some of that .
[84] PATIENT: okay .
[85] PATIENT: and i also want to mention that my feet do swell up a lot .
[86] DOCTOR: okay .
[87] DOCTOR: i'm ... let me take a look at that for just a moment .
[88] DOCTOR: um , any constipation ?
[89] PATIENT: yes , i also do have that problem .
[90] DOCTOR: all right .
[91] DOCTOR: mira- miralax will definitely help with that .
[92] PATIENT: okay , yes , my doctor did also recommend that .
[93] DOCTOR: great .
[94] DOCTOR: all right , let's do an exam real quick .
[95] DOCTOR: please have a seat on this table and i'll listen to your lungs and heart .
[96] PATIENT: okay .
[97] DOCTOR: all right , deep breath .
[98] DOCTOR: all right , again .
[99] PATIENT: okay .
[100] DOCTOR: all right , sounds good .
[101] PATIENT: great .
[102] DOCTOR: let me take a look at your feet and ankles .
[103] PATIENT: okay .
[104] DOCTOR: all right , they look okay right now , certainly let your doctor know about this if it gets any worse or reoccurs .
[105] PATIENT: okay , i will do that .
[106] DOCTOR: now , let's go over your lab work .
[107] DOCTOR: so , when you took that pill , the dexamethasone test , you passed , which means you do n't have cushing's syndrome .
[108] DOCTOR: on that test , at least .
[109] DOCTOR: the salivary cortisol , though , unless you did one wrong ... two of them were completely normal and one was abnormal , so , we might need to repeat that in the future .
[110] PATIENT: okay , that's okay .
[111] DOCTOR: all right , so , your cholesterol was quite high .
[112] DOCTOR: the total cholesterol was 222 .
[113] DOCTOR: the good cholesterol was about 44 .
[114] DOCTOR: the bad was 153 , and it should be less than 100 .
[115] DOCTOR: the non-hdl was about 178 , and it should be less than 130 .
[116] DOCTOR: the good cholesterol should be over 50 , and it was 44 .
[117] DOCTOR: so , your screen for diabetes is ... was fine .
[118] DOCTOR: you do have a vitamin d deficiency , and , i do n't know if we started the vitamin d yet , or not .
[119] PATIENT: yes , we did .
[120] PATIENT: i- i do need to take one today , though .
[121] DOCTOR: okay .
[122] DOCTOR: so , i also checked a lot of other pituitary hormones , iron levels ... everything else seemed to be pretty good , and in decent range .
[123] PATIENT: okay , that sounds great .
[124] PATIENT: so , i wanted to also show you my liver enzymes , um , because i have n't come back since then ... but i was also happy , because one of them was back to normal .
[125] DOCTOR: okay , great .
[126] DOCTOR: let's see them .
[127] PATIENT: okay .
[128] PATIENT: so , the one that's 30 , that was almost 200 not so long ago .
[129] DOCTOR: yeah , your alt was about 128 .
[130] PATIENT: okay , and , and back in october was 254 .
[131] DOCTOR: yeah , this is much better .
[132] PATIENT: okay , great .
[133] PATIENT: and then it dropped in january , and then it dropped a little more in march , since i stopped taking the medicine in december .
[134] DOCTOR: okay , that's good .
[135] DOCTOR: so ... i'm proud of you with the course of your labs , so before i forget , i'm going to , uh , just put your labs into the computer today , and i wo n't be checking your vitamin d level for some time .
[136] PATIENT: okay .
[137] PATIENT: so , with the thyroid , and the low vitamin d , does that always happen together ?
[138] DOCTOR: um , i do have a lot of people that have thyroid , thyroid issues and they have vitamin d deficiency .
[139] PATIENT: okay .
[140] DOCTOR: this is what i'm , um , i'm going to do .
[141] DOCTOR: i'm going to put , print out your prescriptions , so you can shop around at the pharmacies and see if you can find better prices .
[142] PATIENT: okay , that way i can go ask them and try cvs .
[143] DOCTOR: yeah , that sounds like a plan .
[144] PATIENT: okay , good .
[145] PATIENT: so , the weight loss study that you mentioned , when does that start ?
[146] PATIENT: or , how does that work ?
[147] DOCTOR: so , we are about to start , as we just got approval last week , and we are just waiting on our paperwork so we can get started .
[148] PATIENT: okay , and what's involved with that ?
[149] DOCTOR: so , it'll involve you receiving a medication which has been used for diabetes treatment , and it works mostly in the gut on satiety , or satiety hormones .
[150] DOCTOR: um , the most common side effects are going to be nausea , vomiting , diarrhea and constipation .
[151] DOCTOR: they are s- uh , six arms , to the study .
[152] DOCTOR: one is a placebo , the other ones are a , various as ... various dosages of the medication , excuse me .
[153] DOCTOR: um , you would receive an injection once a week .
[154] DOCTOR: also , keep in mind that most of the weight loss medications are not covered by insurance .
[155] PATIENT: okay .
[156] DOCTOR: so , it's a way of getting them , but , the odds of getting one of the arms with the medication that are in your favor , right , might be only one out of five of our hundred patients that we have on the list for the study that will receive the placebo .
[157] PATIENT: okay .
[158] DOCTOR: does that make sense ?
[159] PATIENT: yes , it does .
[160] DOCTOR: so , we do expect pretty big weight loss , because of what we learn in diabetes study .
[161] DOCTOR: so , it's a year long , uh , process , and it's an injection once a week .
[162] DOCTOR: you come in weekly for the first four , five weeks , i believe .
[163] DOCTOR: and then , after that , it's once a month .
[164] DOCTOR: you do get a stipend for partici- for participating in the study , and parking is validated , and whatever else that you need for the study .
[165] PATIENT: okay , do you know how much the stipend is ?
[166] DOCTOR: um , i will have to double check for you , and , you do n't have to be my patient , you just have to meet the criteria .
[167] DOCTOR: so the criteria is a bmi greater than 30 , if you do n't have any other medical condition .
[168] DOCTOR: or , a bmi greater than 27 , if you do have another medical condition , like your cholesterol .
[169] DOCTOR: um , a bmi greater than 27 would quali- uh , qualify you .
[170] PATIENT: i have a friend who might be interested , and she does have diabetes .
[171] DOCTOR: if she has d- diabetes , then she wo n't qualify .
[172] PATIENT: okay , you ca n't if you ... if you have diabetes , got it .
[173] DOCTOR: correct .
[174] DOCTOR: yeah , the only thing that , um , they can not have , really , is diabetes .
[175] DOCTOR: so , either a psychiatric disease , or schizophrenia , bipolar , things like that .
[176] PATIENT: okay .
[177] DOCTOR: but , if they have hypertension , high cholesterol , things like that ... they can definitely sign up .
[178] PATIENT: and they can , okay .
[179] PATIENT: thank you for explaining that .
[180] DOCTOR: of course .
[181] DOCTOR: so , do you want me to try to get you into that study ?
[182] DOCTOR: or , would you just like to try , me to prescribe something ?
[183] DOCTOR: it's kind of up to you .
[184] PATIENT: i think i'll just wait for a little bit now .
[185] DOCTOR: all right , sounds good .
[186] DOCTOR: i'll give you the information for the research , it's just in my office .
[187] DOCTOR: um , it is a different phone number , though .
[188] DOCTOR: so then , if you're interested , just call us within a month , because i do n't know how long , uh , the , the wait will be .
[189] PATIENT: okay , will do .
[190] DOCTOR: perfect .
[191] DOCTOR: so , let me go grab your discount card for the unithroid .
[192] DOCTOR: um , when you go in to activate it , the instructions are on this card , and then you use your insurance ... then , show them this , and ask how much it'll cost .
[193] DOCTOR: if it's too expensive , just let me know .
[194] PATIENT: i will .
[195] PATIENT: thank you so much for your help on that .
[196] DOCTOR: you're welcome .
[197] DOCTOR: then , what i did is , i gave you a topical antibiotic , plus i gave you the benzoyl peroxide .
[198] DOCTOR: so , the peroxide may bleach your sheets , but , you want to make sure to take it and apply it at night , so you do n't have a reaction from the sun during the day .
[199] PATIENT: okay , i can do that .
[200] DOCTOR: but , you do also want to make sure that you do n't mess up your sheets .
[201] PATIENT: okay , sounds good .
[202] DOCTOR: um , so , that's that .
[203] DOCTOR: and then , let's see how you do on the other medications .
[204] DOCTOR: i think this will , this will get better .
[205] DOCTOR: in the meantime , a low-carb diet , avoid alcohol and fatty foods , and low chole- cholesterol foods .
[206] PATIENT: okay .
[207] DOCTOR: and again , once you finish your dose of vitamin d , for the vitamin d deficiency , you're gon na start with the 2000iu daily , so that you're able to maintain those levels .
[208] DOCTOR: sound good ?
[209] PATIENT: yes , that sounds great .
[210] DOCTOR: i really think your liver enzymes are going to get better once you lose the weight , though .
[211] PATIENT: okay , that would be great .
[212] DOCTOR: since we stopped your birth control , we can try once called phexxi , which is kind of like a spermicide , basically .
[213] PATIENT: okay .
[214] DOCTOR: and you just apply it before intercourse .
[215] PATIENT: okay .
[216] DOCTOR: if you need some , uh , just let me know .
[217] PATIENT: okay , i will .
[218] PATIENT: i'll let you know .
[219] DOCTOR: okay , perfect .
[220] DOCTOR: so , stay put for me now .
[221] DOCTOR: i'm going to go see if they have discount samples , and bring you that prescription .
[222] DOCTOR: and then , i'm going to order the labs for next time .
[223] PATIENT: okay , great , thank you so much .
[224] DOCTOR: you're welcome .
[225] DOCTOR: so , under the plan , under abnormal liver enzymes , they have improved since discontinuation of her birth control .
[226] DOCTOR: under abnormal weight gain , her dexamethasone suppression test was normal .
[227] DOCTOR: two out of three salivary cortisol tests were normal , not consistent with cushing's , and therefore we're ruling out cushing's .
[228] DOCTOR: under her hirsutism , her androgen levels were normal .
[229] DOCTOR: for the acne vulgaris , the epiduo was not covered , so we'll try benzoyl peroxide with clindamycin , and remove the previous information .
[230] DOCTOR: on the hyperthyroidism , we'll print out her prescriptions .
[231] DOCTOR: unithroid should be better priced with the discount card , and we'll repeat levels of everything before next visit .
[232] DOCTOR: thanks .assistant

[8] DOCTOR: the outside of your right knee
[9] PATIENT: yeah
[10] DOCTOR: okay and did you actually fall down when this happened or
[11] PATIENT: no i just sorta turned over my ankle
[12] DOCTOR: okay
[13] PATIENT: to the outside and i thought my ankle was the thing that was gon na hurt most but after the ankle soreness went away the only my knee hurt and it sort of clicks when i walk
[14] DOCTOR: and no okay so now it clicks when you walk okay does it hurt when you walk
[15] PATIENT: no unless i stand on one foot for an extended period of time like leaning my foot up against the wall
[16] DOCTOR: okay
[17] PATIENT: then i feel like it's locked and then i sort of have to ease into walking again
[18] DOCTOR: okay and what have you taken for the pain
[19] PATIENT: really nothing
[20] DOCTOR: okay
[21] PATIENT: ibuprofen but i'm not a big pill taker so i sort of sucked it up and
[22] DOCTOR: does the ibuprofen work
[23] PATIENT: at night you know during the day i'm more active so it it really does n't impact it because i just work through it but at night it does help me to settle down and sleep better
[24] DOCTOR: does your knee hurt when you're just resting and sitting there
[25] PATIENT: no when it's up it's fine when it's down on the floor with my foot flat it's fine it does hurt when i rest it on my heel
[26] DOCTOR: okay and are you able to do things like bending or things like that
[27] PATIENT: a full squat that's when i feel the most clicking like if i go all the way down to a full squat like a catcher that's when i feel the most clicking but otherwise no there is no pain it's just the clicking and i'm fearful that that's an injury of some type
[28] DOCTOR: okay alright now you said squats are you are you active are you doing like burpees going to
[29] PATIENT: no i ride the bike
[30] DOCTOR: okay
[31] PATIENT: i ride the bike i ride the bike which i'm not doing now peloton inside for the winter i do have a winter bike though
[32] DOCTOR: okay alright well i have a peloton who is your favorite instructor
[33] PATIENT: i i actually do n't have a favorite instructor i have more favorite rides
[34] DOCTOR: okay what kind of rides do you like
[35] PATIENT: i like rock music and regain music rides so whoever is doing those in a began or a medium content i'm cool with
[36] DOCTOR: i ca n't picture you as a regade person so that's interesting to know okay alright and any numbing or tingling in your foot at all
[37] PATIENT: yes but not from the knee injury i broke my foot my second toe on my right foot and i have numbness depending upon the shoe i wear
[38] DOCTOR: okay when did you break your toe
[39] PATIENT: i've broken it three times over the last ten years so it's just something that's a an annoyance but it was n't caused by this injury
[40] DOCTOR: okay so you do have some numbing and tingling but it's not new
[41] PATIENT: right correct
[42] DOCTOR: alright alright well let's just go ahead and i'm gon na go ahead and do a quick physical exam i'm gon na be calling out my exam findings i'll let you know what that means so on your musculoskeletal exam on your right knee i do appreciate some slight edema you do have a slight effusion does it hurt when i press on the outside of your knee
[43] PATIENT: no not physically
[44] DOCTOR: okay there is no pain to palpation of the right lateral knee i'm gon na be bending your knee in all sorts of positions does that hurt
[45] PATIENT: only when you pull it to the outside
[46] DOCTOR: okay
[47] PATIENT: from my my foot when you pull it to the outside that's the only time it hurts
[48] DOCTOR: okay the patient has a positive varus test there is full range of motion there is a negative lachman sign the patient does on cardiovascular exam the patient does have a palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulse okay well let's just i wan na talk a little bit about i had the nurse do an x-ray on you and i looked at the results of your knee x-ray and it does n't show any acute fracture or bony abnormality which is not surprising based on your injury so let's just talk a little bit about you know my assessment and my plan for you so i think you do have a a lateral a lateral collateral ligament strain based on your exam findings and this this type of injury essentially can be healed by itself you know i do n't think we're gon na need to refer you to surgery or anything like that i want you to go ahead and i'm gon na prescribe meloxicam fifteen milligrams once a day i do wan na go ahead and refer you to physical therapy because if we strengthen up those muscles and areas around that injury then that will make your knee stronger it help prevent future injuries are you able to ice it at all during the day now you said you working you work in sales so you said you're home
[49] PATIENT: yeah i actually i'm at home so i can ice it and i have been icing it
[50] DOCTOR: okay
[51] PATIENT: i mean twenty on twenty off at least four times a day
[52] DOCTOR: okay and so does that help at all
[53] PATIENT: it's it it makes it feel better in the morning when i first go to my desk and at the end of the day before bed you know i take ibuprofen so i do n't have swelling overnight but honestly i have a pretty decent threshold for pain so it's not good it's not changing it by much
[54] DOCTOR: okay do you feel like your symptoms are getting worse or better i think i think pretty much for the last two weeks they've remained about the same the the only time i feel like they get worse is when i exert myself doing up and down like gardening in the yard or moving pots
[55] PATIENT: and stuff outside that's the only time i felt like it got any worse but nothing to the point where it stayed worse
[56] DOCTOR: okay alright well let's go ahead and refer you to physical therapy if you're still having pain then we might have to consider an mri
[57] PATIENT: okay
[58] DOCTOR: any questions about that
[59] PATIENT: no
[60] DOCTOR: okay alright well it was very nice seeing you today call me if you need anything
[61] PATIENT: i will
[62] DOCTOR: okay bye

[15] PATIENT: I, I've really not been feeling so well at all recently.
[16] PATIENT: I, I've been struggling with fever for the past week.
[17] PATIENT: Yeah, I would say it's about seven days ago.
[18] PATIENT: I'm just, I'm really hot and sweaty all the time, and just generally not feeling good.
[19] DOCTOR: OK, alright, sorry to hear that.
[20] DOCTOR: Now, um, uh, along with this fever and this any other symptoms at all?
[21] PATIENT: Um, I'd say that I'm aching all over really, my muscles are really aching.

[27] PATIENT: Yes, yes, quite interchangeable, not really a pattern to it.
[28] DOCTOR: OK, uh, and have you been taking your medication?
[29] PATIENT: Uh, I've been trying to, like, take ibuprofen and paracetamol just to from over the counter, but it's not really helping, just been taking the recommended dose every day of those.
[30] DOCTOR: Sure, and when you say it's not helping, is it bringing the temperature down at all?
[31] PATIENT: Perhaps slightly, yes, but I'm still experiencing these symptoms, so, it does take the edge off a bit.
[32] DOCTOR: OK, alright.
[33] DOCTOR: And can I just double check have you gotten any cough or cold or sore throat or anything like that?
[34] PATIENT: Mmm, not those sort of symptoms, really.
[35] PATIENT: Um
[36] DOCTOR: But which are you getting, other than the ones you've already mentioned to me?
[37] PATIENT: Um, so, I have a habit

[56] DOCTOR: OK.
[57] DOCTOR: OK, so, you know your normal headache, where is that, in the back of your head or the front of the head?
[58] PATIENT: Uum, it's quite centralized over, over the head.
[59] DOCTOR: OK. and how long have you been having that for?
[60] PATIENT: It's something that I've struggled with through, years really, just related to a screen use, or, uum, like changes in weather patterns.

[105] DOCTOR: Now, do you have, um, any other illnesses at all, in the past?
[106] PATIENT: Mmm, as I said I've, I've been struggling with back pain for quite a while, but I haven't really had any, uh, major illnesses in the past, I can think of.
[107] DOCTOR: And that back pain have you, um, have you seen anyone about that?
[108] PATIENT: Yes, yeah, I'm under a physiotherapist at the moment for that.
[109] DOCTOR: Have they, have they give you any kind of diagnosis at all?
[110] PATIENT: Um, they've said that it's, u,h related to long periods of time sitting at a desk, and just, uh, bad posture.
[111] PATIENT: So mainly the exercises are focused on improving posture and, and to strengthen the muscles in the back.
[112] DOCTOR: Alright um, are there any illnesses in your family at all?
[113] PATIENT: Hmm, the main one would be, um, heart attack.
[114] PATIENT: My, my father passed away of that.

[117] PATIENT: in his sixties.

[120] DOCTOR: OK. Um, are you on any medication at all?
[121] PATIENT: Uh, just Seroxat.
[122] DOCTOR: OK.
[123] DOCTOR: Uh, do you have any allergies at all?
[124] DOCTOR: medication?
[125] PATIENT: No, I've just really pollen allergy.
[126] PATIENT: That's all I have.
[127] DOCTOR: OK, so hay fever.
[128] PATIENT: Yes, yeah, just hay fever.
[129] DOCTOR: Alright.
[130] DOCTOR: Um, are you, um, you're working at the moment?
[131] PATIENT: Uh, I am, yes.
[132] DOCTOR: What do you work at?
[133] PATIENT: I work as a nurse.
[134] DOCTOR: OK, all right.
[135] DOCTOR: Um, and, um, you're up to date with all the vaccinations, Hepatitis B, and that kind of thing?
[136] PATIENT: Yes, indeed.
[137] PATIENT: Yeah.
[138] DOCTOR: OK.
[139] PATIENT: But I'm, I'm really struggling quite a lot at work at the moment.
[140] PATIENT: It's been quite difficult, feeling so, uh, tired all the time.
[141] DOCTOR: So, I can .
[142] DOCTOR: Sure, OK. Um, and, are you a, uh, are you a smoker at all?
[143] PATIENT: No, I'm not.
[144] DOCTOR: OK, and ohh do you drink much alcohol?
[145] PATIENT: Mmm, moderate alcohol intake.
[146] PATIENT: Yeah, I don't drink too much.
[147] DOCTOR: OK, and how much kind of physical exercise do you do normally?
[148] PATIENT: I try and do, uh, some moderate physical exercise a few times a week.
[149] DOCTOR: OK, that's good, alright, um, so, um
[150] DOCTOR: What, uh, I think we're gonna need to do is we're gonna need to bring you into one of our clinics.
[151] DOCTOR: Examine , and we're gonna need to arrange some blood tests as well.
[152] PATIENT: OK.
[153] DOCTOR: OK, um, so, what what I want to do is, the first question I have in my mind is that we need to find a reason for why you've got this fever and these symptoms, because there's no apparent reason from what you've told me.
[154] PATIENT: OK.
[155] DOCTOR: There's no, uh, when someone has got fever and sweats, we want to find out have they got chest infection, have they got a throat infection?
[156] DOCTOR: Um, and if we can't find a focus of infection, then that's something, that, that's an outstanding question that needs to be answered, OK?
[157] DOCTOR: Um, the second thing, second factor, is that you've recently come from, uh, Vietnam.
[158] PATIENT: OK.
[159] DOCTOR: And you've had exposure to rural areas.
[160] DOCTOR: And we need to think about things like malaria or other exotic infections as well.
[161] DOCTOR: So, um, you're probably gonna need some blood tests.
[162] DOCTOR: After you've been seen by somebody.
[163] DOCTOR: Um, now, the urgency of those blood tests depends partly on what we find when we examine you, which is why we're going to go, go for the examination first.
[164] DOCTOR: You come into one of our clinics in central London, that's one option, and then the the GP there who examines you can then decide on how urgent the blood tests and things are going to be.
[165] PATIENT: OK.
[166] DOCTOR: Or, if it's inconvenient for you to come into central London because you you're living further out, you could actually just attend a local A and E.
[167] DOCTOR: I'm going to type up what my thought process is and what kind of test I think you need in the notes for this appointment, so you could show that to them at reception.
[168] DOCTOR: Um, I'll be asking for something called thick and thin blood films, to check for malaria.
[169] DOCTOR: And inflammatory markers and things like those, technical terms, but they'll understand what that, what I'm talking about.
[170] DOCTOR: But, um, I, I don't think you can go into work, uh, until we've sorted this out.
[171] DOCTOR: And we, we, we need to sort this out sooner rather than later.
[172] PATIENT: OK. That sounds great.
[173] PATIENT: Thank you so much for your help.
[174] PATIENT: I, I think, yeah, I can come straight into central London today to get that sorted.
[175] DOCTOR: OK.
[176] DOCTOR: OK, fine, so what I'm going to do is I will send a message to one of our admin team members asking them to book you in.
[177] DOCTOR: And if you can ring the number that I leave in your consultation notes, after a few minutes, and then they'll slot you in, and then we can sort things out from there.
[178] DOCTOR: OK?
[179] PATIENT: That's brilliant.
[180] PATIENT: Thank you very much.
[181] DOCTOR: Alright then, OK. Take care then.
[182] DOCTOR: All the best.
[183] PATIENT: Goodbye.
[184] DOCTOR: Bye.assistant

[1] DOCTOR: tyler nelson , date of birth : 3 , 6 , 1949 , mrn , 385729 .
[2] DOCTOR: he is here today for ongoing management of rheumatoid arthritis .
[3] DOCTOR: last time he was here , he received a steroid injection in his right knee .
[4] DOCTOR: hello mr. nelson , how are you ?
[5] PATIENT: um , about the same as last time .
[6] PATIENT: my knee is still swollen .
[7] DOCTOR: that was your right knee , correct ?
[8] DOCTOR: i take it the injection did n't help ?
[9] PATIENT: it did , maybe for a couple of weeks .
[10] DOCTOR: that's it ?
[11] DOCTOR: and is it still painful ?
[12] PATIENT: yeah , it's pretty painful , and now the whole leg is getting swollen .
[13] DOCTOR: okay , what would you say your pain level is ?
[14] PATIENT: i mean , right now it's about a 3 or so , but , typically on a normal day it's around 6 .
[15] DOCTOR: okay , and its been swollen like that for how long now ?
[16] PATIENT: since i was last here a couple weeks after that .
[17] PATIENT: so about , maybe two months now .
[18] DOCTOR: okay , but before it was just the knee ?
[19] PATIENT: yeah , the whole thing was n't swollen like this , but i tried to wear compression socks a lot of the time , but it has n't been helping .
[20] DOCTOR: okay , okay , so that has n't been working for you ?
[21] PATIENT: i mean , it helps to some degree , but it's still swollen , especially around the knee .
[22] DOCTOR: hmm .
[23] DOCTOR: has it been keeping you from doing things during the day ?
[24] PATIENT: well , i slowed down a little bit , and i found a few things too fast .
[25] PATIENT: but when it really hurts , is when i've been sitting for a while , and then i have to try and get up .
[26] PATIENT: i'm so stiff getting up i have to use a cane to get my bearings .
[27] PATIENT: i mean , after a little bit , it loosens up , but that first getting up is real difficult .
[28] DOCTOR: yeah , i can see , that makes sense .
[29] DOCTOR: have you been taking your medication regularly ?
[30] DOCTOR: your on xeljanz right ?
[31] PATIENT: yeah , the xr , i think its , uhm , 11 milligrams a day ?
[32] PATIENT: yeah , but i'm taking it everyday , and i'm also taking celebrex which i started maybe 2 months ago .
[33] DOCTOR: yes , the 200mgs daily .
[34] DOCTOR: how's that working for you ?
[35] PATIENT: pretty good , up until it started swelling again .
[36] DOCTOR: okay , well come sit over here , and if you could take of your socks and shoes , and we'll take a look at your knee .
[37] DOCTOR: and just to let you know , i have a service now that writes my note about the visit , so you'll hear me call things out and describe what i see fully .
[38] PATIENT: okay , gotcha .
[39] DOCTOR: right , so let's check your leg .
[40] DOCTOR: can you straighten it , and does it hurt ?
[41] PATIENT: yeah , when i try to straighten it all the way it does .
[42] DOCTOR: okay , range of motion slightly diminished .
[43] DOCTOR: i'm going to press here , okay ?
[44] DOCTOR: and how about here , hmm , i see some pitting around the knee and ankle .
[45] DOCTOR: normal capillary refill in the toes .
[46] DOCTOR: does any of this area hurt ?
[47] PATIENT: um , just kinda sore , like an old bruise ?
[48] DOCTOR: so , i can feel that the knee is hot , and that means there's something going on , like some inflammation .
[49] DOCTOR: so we can give you another steroid injection for that .
[50] DOCTOR: i also want to get an x-ray of that knee , so we can see where all the swelling is coming from .
[51] PATIENT: yeah .
[52] PATIENT: let's do it .
[53] PATIENT: sounds go to me .
[54] DOCTOR: okay , and did we set up physical therapy for you last time you were here ?
[55] PATIENT: yeah , that was some years ago , but that was the other knee .
[56] DOCTOR: okay .
[57] DOCTOR: so i think we'll set that up for you now .
[58] DOCTOR: we'll also do an x-ray on that knee .
[59] DOCTOR: i can send you for a physical therapy , and if nothing is helping , then we really might need to get a surgery consult to see what we can do with that knee .
[60] PATIENT: okay , sounds like a plan .
[61] DOCTOR: all right , so for today we'll go ahead and we'll give you the steroid shot .
[62] DOCTOR: i'll try to see if i can get a little bit of fluid out before i do give you the injection .
[63] DOCTOR: there might be no fluid , but i'll see if i can get anything out regardless .
[64] PATIENT: okay .
[65] PATIENT: and that's a procedure you're going to do right now ?
[66] DOCTOR: yep .
[67] DOCTOR: once we're done talking here , and as far as the edema in your legs , uh , we'll take an x-ray to look for the cause , but there is a lot you can do as well .
[68] DOCTOR: the compression socks are a good start .
[69] DOCTOR: um , and also , do you eat a lot of salt ?
[70] PATIENT: i mean , um , i mean i love my salty snacks .
[71] DOCTOR: okay .
[72] DOCTOR: well , salt does have a tendency to make your body hold on to water , reducing your salt intake could help with some of the swelling .
[73] DOCTOR: you can also prop your feet up any time you get a chance , especially at night .
[74] DOCTOR: and have you talked to your private care doctor about this at all ?
[75] PATIENT: no , i figured i would just come here first .
[76] DOCTOR: okay .
[77] DOCTOR: so i think , try some of those things out first , and if it does n't help , definitely make an appointment with them , also , as you know , xeljanz is a high-risk medication , so we need to check your cmp levels every couple of months .
[78] DOCTOR: so this time your levels are good , but do make sure to make an appointment for the blood work for next time .
[79] PATIENT: all right .
[80] PATIENT: i can do that .
[81] PATIENT: thank you so much doc .
[82] DOCTOR: yes , of course .
[83] DOCTOR: well let me go ahead and get supplies and we'll get to work on your knee .
[84] DOCTOR: fluid aspiration and steroid injection procedure .
[85] DOCTOR: the risks , benefits , and alternatives were explained .
[86] DOCTOR: the risks of steroid injection were explained , including , but not limited to : hypopigmentation , soft tissue atrophy , tendon ruptures , and transient hypoglycemia among others .
[87] DOCTOR: verbal consent was attained .
[88] DOCTOR: the right knee was , uh , um , accessed through the lateral approach with 3 milliliters of initially clear fluid , then bloo- blood tinged fluid .
[89] DOCTOR: then the right knee was prepped in a standard-fashion .
[90] DOCTOR: the right knee was injected with 80 milligrams of triamcinolone , and one milliliter of lidocaine .
[91] DOCTOR: the procedure was tolerated well , with no complications .
[92] DOCTOR: post-procedure instructions were given .
[93] DOCTOR: patient will follow up with his pcp .
[94] DOCTOR: thank you .assistant

[106] DOCTOR: So that's what we need to .
[107] DOCTOR: Because to actually make you function a bit more, we'll start you on certain medications.

[109] DOCTOR: So this is like just symptomatic relief like you have a fever we just give paracetamol.
[110] DOCTOR: So just to, you know, make you able to come and see one of the doctors and things like that.
[111] DOCTOR: while you're with the doctors, we'd like to do your blood pressure, just examine your, you know, you know, how your walking and everything is.
[112] DOCTOR: OK, while we're waiting, while you're waiting on seeing the doctor if you double up any weakness of your legs or arms or, or, you know, a sudden headache.
[113] PATIENT: OK.

[126] PATIENT: OK, thank you so much.
[127] DOCTOR: Any questions at all?
[128] PATIENT: Um, can you take, do you need to take those tablets with food?
[129] PATIENT: Or can you just take them any time?
[130] DOCTOR: It doesn't really matter, you can take it, because sometimes, you know, you get the symptoms as soon as you wake up, so probably you'll feel a bit sick to eat anything so might as well just take the tablets.
